# Step 02: Site Assessment

## Objective

Map the Seigr Hub property to identify specific locations for:

- Forest humus collection zones
- Stream sediment and manganese nodule sources
- Moraine deposit access points
- Groundwater or spring locations
- Optimal system placement

## Why This Matters

The geological data tells us what exists regionally - now we need to find it locally. Different parts of your property will have different resource concentrations. Knowing where to collect materials saves time and maximizes quality.

## Tools Needed

- **Topographic map** or GPS device (smartphone works)
- **Notebook** for documenting locations
- **Camera** for visual documentation
- **Small shovel** for test pits (30cm depth max)
- **pH test strips** (optional, ~$10)
- **Magnet** (strong neodymium type for testing iron content)
- **Clear jar** (for water sample visibility test)
- **Measuring tape** (50m is ideal)

## Assessment Zones

### **Zone 1: Forest Floor (Humus Collection)**

**What to look for:**

**Ideal characteristics:**

- Dense canopy overhead (spruce/pine forest)
- Thick layer of decomposed needles and organic matter
- Dark brown to black color (high decomposition)
- Slightly moist but not waterlogged
- Away from human disturbance

**How to test quality:**

1. **Depth test:**
   - Clear away fresh needles (light brown layer)
   - Measure dark humus layer thickness
   - Target: >5cm thick is good, >10cm is excellent

2. **Color test:**
   - Scoop a handful
   - Very dark brown to black = high Fe content
   - Red-brown = oxidized iron (still good)
   - Tan or light brown = low decomposition (skip)

3. **Magnetic test:**
   - Dry a small sample completely
   - Burn in metal can until black (simple char)
   - Strong magnet should attract particles
   - Attraction = Fe-rich (excellent for our use)

4. **Smell test:**
   - Fresh, earthy smell = active decomposition (good)
   - Sour or sulfur smell = waterlogged (avoid)
   - No smell = too dry/old (marginal)

**Location strategy:**

- Mark 3-5 collection zones on map
- Rotate collection to avoid depleting any area
- Never take >50% of humus from any 10m² area
- Allow 2-3 years recovery before re-harvesting

**Expected yield:**

- 5kg humus per 20m² of forest floor
- Need 2-3kg per electrode batch
- One good collection zone serves entire build

**Documentation:**

```
Example entry:
Location: 59.XXXXX°N, 10.XXXXX°E
Zone name: "Northeast ridge spruce stand"
Humus depth: 8cm
Color: Very dark brown
Magnetic test: Strong attraction
Notes: Dense canopy, minimal understory, excellent quality
```

### **Zone 2: Stream Locations (Sediment & Nodules)**

**What to look for:**

**Ideal stream characteristics:**

- Flows over granitic bedrock or gravel
- Clear water (not muddy)
- Moderate flow (not stagnant, not rushing torrent)
- Accessible banks for sample collection
- >100m from roads or buildings

**Manganese nodule identification:**

**Visual:**

- Dark brown to black, round to irregular shapes
- Size: Usually 5-20mm diameter
- Surface: May be rough or smooth, sometimes shiny when wet
- Context: Often in gravel bars or depositional zones

**Physical:**

- **Much heavier than regular stones** (high density)
- Slightly magnetic (iron-manganese oxides)
- Break apart to reveal concentric layers (like an onion)
- Sometimes leave dark stains on hands when handled wet

**Testing for nodules:**

1. **Magnet test:**
   - Dry suspected nodules
   - Strong magnet should attract weakly to moderately
   - Pure granite = no attraction
   - Mn-Fe nodules = moderate attraction

2. **Density test:**
   - Nodules sink quickly in water
   - Feel heavy for their size
   - ~2-3× denser than granite pebbles

3. **Break test:**
   - Crack one open with hammer
   - Should show concentric layering
   - Interior darker than exterior
   - May see rust-brown or black bands

**Where to find them:**

- Inside bends of streams (depositional zones)
- Gravel bars after spring floods
- Edges of pools where current slows
- NOT in fast-flowing rapids (erosion zones)

**Collection protocol:**

- Collect only from active stream beds (not banks)
- Take <10% of visible nodules in any area
- Leave larger ones (>30mm) for continued growth
- Document GPS location for future collection

**Expected yield:**

- 50-200g nodules per productive site
- Need 100-200g per large electrode
- Multiple small collections better than one large

**Documentation:**

```
Example entry:
Location: 59.XXXXX°N, 10.XXXXX°E
Stream name: "Cabin creek, lower pool"
Water clarity: Clear, slight brown tint
Nodule density: ~20 visible in 1m² area
Size range: 8-18mm average
Magnetic test: Moderate attraction
Notes: Inside bend, gravel bar, high quality samples
```

### **Zone 3: Moraine Deposits**

**What to look for:**

**Characteristics of glacial moraine:**

- Unsorted mixture of particle sizes (clay to boulders)
- No layering or stratification
- Angular (not rounded) stones
- Often reddish or gray color
- Exposed in banks, road cuts, gravel pits

**How to identify:**

1. **Texture test:**
   - Squeeze moist sample in hand
   - Should contain sand, silt, clay all mixed
   - Gritty feel with sticky components
   - Not uniform like beach sand

2. **Particle size test:**
   - Look at cross-section of exposed bank
   - Should see everything from dust to rocks mixed together
   - No sorting by size (unlike river deposits)
   - Random distribution = glacial origin

3. **Fizz test (calcium carbonate):**
   - Take small sample of fine material
   - Add few drops vinegar or lemon juice
   - Fizzing = calcium carbonate present (excellent for pH buffering)
   - No fizz = lower Ca content (still usable but less ideal)

**Best sources:**

- Road cuts through hills
- Stream banks exposing subsurface material
- Old gravel pits
- Erosion scarps on hillsides

**What to avoid:**

- River gravel (too sorted, lower mineral diversity)
- Beach deposits (too weathered, salt contamination)
- Topsoil (contains organics, we want pure mineral)

**Collection protocol:**

- Collect from mid-bank (not topsoil layer)
- Take material 20-50cm below surface
- Screen to remove >20mm particles (too large)
- Remove organic debris (sticks, roots)

**Expected yield:**

- 20L from a small exposed bank
- Need 10-15L per 1m³ system
- One good source provides enough for entire build

**Documentation:**

```
Example entry:
Location: 59.XXXXX°N, 10.XXXXX°E
Source: "Road cut 200m north of cabin"
Exposure depth: 1.5m visible
Fizz test: Strong reaction (high Ca)
Particle distribution: Clay 20%, silt 30%, sand 40%, gravel 10%
Notes: Easy access, abundant supply, excellent quality
```

### **Zone 4: Water Sources**

**Groundwater vs. Surface Water vs. Rainwater:**

**Groundwater (best for our system):**

- Natural electrolytes (Ca, Mg, K, Na)
- Stable temperature year-round
- Filtered through soil (cleaner)
- Higher conductivity

**Surface water (good, with testing):**

- Stream or lake water
- More variable quality
- May contain sediments
- Test before use

**Rainwater (fallback option):**

- Very low conductivity (poor electrolyte)
- Requires mineral supplementation
- Use only if no groundwater access

**Testing groundwater quality:**

1. **Visual clarity test:**
   - Collect 1L in clear glass jar
   - Let settle 24 hours
   - Should be mostly clear
   - Slight color OK (tannins from organics)
   - Heavy sediment or murky = needs filtration

2. **Smell test:**
   - Fresh, mineral smell = good
   - Slight iron smell (metallic) = excellent (Fe present)
   - Sulfur smell (rotten egg) = avoid (sulfate-reducing bacteria)
   - Petroleum smell = contaminated (do not use)

3. **Taste test (if it looks/smells good):**
   - Slightly mineral taste = perfect
   - Strong mineral/salty = too high (dilute with rain)
   - No taste = low minerals (like rainwater)
   - Any chemical taste = do not use

4. **pH test:**
   - Use pH strips
   - Optimal: 6.5-7.5
   - Acceptable: 6.0-8.0
   - Outside range: Can still use but monitor in system

5. **Conductivity test (if you have meter):**
   - Optimal: 200-500 µS/cm
   - Acceptable: 100-800 µS/cm
   - <100 = too pure (like rainwater)
   - >800 = very mineral-rich (dilute 50/50 with rain)

**Practical conductivity test without meter:**

- Fill bucket with water
- Add pinch of wood ash (contains K, Ca)
- Stir and let settle 1 hour
- If water was already mineral-rich: Little change in clarity
- If water was pure: Noticeable cloudiness = low minerals

**Documentation:**

```
Example entry:
Location: 59.XXXXX°N, 10.XXXXX°E
Source type: Shallow well, 3m depth
Visual: Clear with slight brown tint
Smell: Slight iron/mineral smell
pH: 7.0
Estimated conductivity: Moderate-high (based on taste)
Notes: Leaves orange stain on rocks = Fe present = excellent
```

### **Zone 5: System Placement**

**Optimal location characteristics:**

**Proximity:**

- <50m from cabin (for monitoring)
- <100m from humus collection zones
- <200m from stream (if using nodules)
- <20m from water source

**Terrain:**

- Level or gentle slope (<5°)
- Good drainage (never pools after rain)
- Not in frost pocket (cold air settling area)
- Protected from strongest winds

**Access:**

- Year-round access (not snow-blocked in winter)
- Can bring materials via wheelbarrow
- Comfortable working space (3m clearance around)

**Sunlight:**

- Partial shade better than full sun (prevents overheating)
- Morning sun OK (warms system earlier in day)
- Afternoon shade preferred (prevents late-day temperature spikes)

**Environmental:**
>
- >30m from any water body (prevent runoff contamination)
- >10m from property boundaries
- Not in wildlife corridors or nesting areas
- Screened from view if aesthetics matter

**Testing the site:**

1. **Drainage test:**
   - Dig 30cm deep hole
   - Fill with water
   - Should drain within 4-12 hours
   - <2 hours = too fast (very sandy)
   - >24 hours = too slow (clay layer, choose different spot)

2. **Level test:**
   - Use level or smartphone level app
   - Check 2m in each direction from center
   - <5° slope = good
   - Can build up low side with gravel if needed

3. **Sun exposure test:**
   - Visit site at 9am, noon, 3pm, 6pm on sunny day
   - Note sun/shade at each time
   - Ideal: Shade 12pm-6pm, sun OK morning

4. **Frost test (if possible):**
   - Check in early spring morning
   - Look for frost on ground
   - If surrounding areas thawed but site still frosted = frost pocket
   - Choose higher ground

**Documentation:**

```
Example entry:
Location: 59.XXXXX°N, 10.XXXXX°E
Description: "Flat area 30m southeast of cabin"
Slope: <2° (nearly level)
Drainage test: Emptied in 6 hours (good)
Sun exposure: Shaded after 2pm (ideal)
Distance to humus zone: 40m
Distance to stream: 150m
Distance to well: 15m
Notes: Perfect spot, start clearing
```

## Creating Your Resource Map

**On paper or digitally:**

1. **Base map:**
   - Sketch property boundaries
   - Mark cabin, outbuildings
   - Show streams, water sources
   - Indicate elevation changes (even roughly)

2. **Add resource zones:**
   - Color code: Green = humus, Blue = water, Brown = moraine, Orange = streams
   - Circle high-quality areas
   - Note accessibility (easy/moderate/difficult)

3. **Mark optimal system location:**
   - Central to resources when possible
   - Consider distances to each zone
   - Verify drainage and sun exposure

4. **Plan access routes:**
   - How will you transport materials?
   - Wheelbarrow paths, carrying routes
   - Temporary material storage near build site

**Example map notation:**

```
[Cabin] --40m--> [System Site] <--15m-- [Well]
                      |
                   150m down
                      |
                  [Stream]
           (Mn nodules, gravel)
                      
Northern ridge: Dense humus (8-12cm, Fe-rich)
Road cut 200m N: Moraine deposit (Ca-rich, accessible)
```

## Quality Checks

After completing this step, you should have:

✅ **Mapped 3-5 humus collection zones** with depth and quality notes  
✅ **Identified stream locations** with nodule presence documented  
✅ **Located moraine deposits** with fizz test results  
✅ **Tested water source** with clarity, pH, conductivity estimates  
✅ **Selected system location** with drainage and sun exposure verified  
✅ **Created resource map** showing all zones and distances  
✅ **Documented everything** with GPS coordinates and photos  

## Timeline

- **Initial walk-around:** 2-3 hours
- **Detailed zone assessment:** 4-6 hours over 2-3 days
- **Testing and documentation:** 2-3 hours
- **Map creation:** 1 hour

**Total:** 9-13 hours spread over several days

## Next Step

**Step 03: Choose Location** - Now that resources are mapped, we'll finalize the exact system placement and prepare the site.

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't find manganese nodules in streams"**

- Not critical - system works without them (20-30% less efficient)
- Check lake edges, pond sediments
- Can substitute with rust (Fe oxide) on cathodes
- Consider purchasing MnO₂ powder (small amount, lasts years)

**"All humus zones are thin (<5cm)"**

- Collect from larger area (more gentle harvesting)
- Mix with purchased biochar to extend volume
- Still better than no local humus at all

**"Groundwater tests show high conductivity (>800 µS/cm)"**

- Dilute 50/50 with rainwater when using
- Very mineral-rich is good - just needs tempering
- Monitor system performance and adjust ratio

**"My property has no moraine deposits"**

- Check for limestone gravel (also Ca-rich)
- Use crushed eggshells as Ca source (save kitchen waste)
- Agricultural lime (last resort, small amounts)

**"Drainage test shows >24 hour retention"**

- Choose different location (not negotiable)
- Or install French drain beneath system
- Clay layers cause water buildup = system failure

## Additional Notes

### **Seasonal Timing**

**Best time for assessment:**

- **Spring (April-May):** Water sources at peak, easy to find
- **Summer (June-August):** Full forest growth, humus layer visible
- **Fall (September-October):** Humus thickest after summer decomposition
- **Avoid winter:** Snow cover, frozen ground, limited access

### **Safety Considerations**

**When in forest:**

- Tell someone where you're going
- Bring phone, whistle, first aid
- Watch for wildlife (moose, especially during calving season)
- Mark trail if going off paths

**When near water:**

- Stream banks can be unstable
- Wear boots with good grip
- Don't wade in unknown depths
- Be cautious after heavy rain (higher, faster flows)

**When handling soil/rock:**

- Wear gloves (sharp stones, soil bacteria)
- Wash hands before eating
- Clean tools after use
- Store samples in sealed containers

### **Documentation Best Practices**

**Photos to take:**

- Wide shot showing context
- Close-up of material quality
- Reference object for scale (coin, hand, ruler)
- GPS coordinates visible if possible

**Notes to record:**

- Date and time of collection
- Weather conditions (affects water tests)
- Surrounding vegetation
- Any unusual observations

This documentation helps you:

- Remember good spots for future collection
- Troubleshoot if material quality varies
- Share knowledge with other Seigr builders
- Track ecological changes over years

**By the end of this step**, you should feel confident you know exactly where every material will come from and how to access it efficiently.

**Next up:** Selecting the final system location and beginning site preparation!
