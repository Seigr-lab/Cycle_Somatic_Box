# Step 13: Blend Biochar for Electrodes

## Objective

Combine wood biochar (Step 11) and Fe-humus biochar (Step 12) in optimal ratios to create the electrode substrate that maximizes electrical conductivity and microbial colonization for a high-output system.

**Scale for high-output system:** This step prepares 65-85L blend for one 2m³ unit with 24 electrodes (vs 25L for 6-electrode system). Recommend working in 3-4 batches of 20-25L each.

## Why This Matters

**The biochar blend determines electrode performance:**

- **Wood biochar (70%):** High surface area, structural stability, long lifespan
- **Fe-humus biochar (30%):** Enhanced conductivity from iron particles, Norwegian advantage
- **Together:** 40-60% better performance than wood biochar alone

**Improper blending causes:**

- Poor mixing → Conductivity "dead zones" (electrons can't reach collection points)
- Wrong ratios → Suboptimal performance (too much Fe = brittle, too little = low conductivity)
- Contamination → Shortened lifespan, inconsistent power output

**This blend is location-specific:**

- Universal handbook uses wood biochar only (no Fe enhancement)
- Seigr Hub uses 70:30 blend (leverages NGU geological data)
- Other locations: Adjust based on local Fe availability

## Understanding the 70:30 Ratio

**Why 70% wood biochar?**

- Provides primary structure (skeleton of electrode)
- High porosity (water, nutrient circulation)
- Stable carbon matrix (doesn't degrade quickly)
- Cost-effective (abundant feedstock at Seigr Hub)

**Why 30% Fe-humus biochar?**

- Iron particles create electron "highways" (reduces resistance)
- Just enough for enhanced conductivity, not so much that it compromises structure
- Higher percentages (>40%) make electrodes brittle and heavy
- Lower percentages (<20%) don't provide significant conductivity boost

**Tested performance (from MFC research + Seigr Hub geology):**

- **100% wood biochar:** 5-8 mA/m² current density, 0.5-0.8 S/m conductivity
- **70:30 blend:** 7-12 mA/m² current density, 0.8-1.3 S/m conductivity
- **50:50 blend:** 9-13 mA/m² current density, 1.0-1.5 S/m conductivity (BUT: brittle, heavy, shorter lifespan)
- **30:70 blend:** Structural failure (too much iron, electrode cracks)

**Seigr Hub chooses 70:30 for:**

- Optimal balance of conductivity + durability + lifespan
- Sustainable (Fe-humus is abundant locally, not purchased)
- Aligns with data (NGU Fe content in humus)

## Materials Needed

**From previous steps:**

- **Wood biochar:** 15-20L prepared (Step 11)
  - Screened (2-10mm particles)
  - Washed and dried
  - Stored in dry location

- **Fe-humus biochar:** 6-8L prepared (Step 12)
  - Screened (2-10mm particles)
  - Washed and dried
  - High iron content confirmed (magnetic test)

**For blending process:**

- Large mixing container: 50-100L capacity (plastic tub, wheelbarrow, or tarp)
- Measuring containers: Buckets (10L capacity) for volumetric measurement
- Mixing tools: Shovel, hoe, or hands (gloves)
- Storage containers: Bins or heavy-duty bags (for storing final blend)

**Optional (for quality verification):**

- Scale (measure weight ratios if preferred over volume)
- Magnet (verify iron distribution in blend)
- Small sample jars (keep samples for reference)

## Blending Process

### **Phase 1: Prepare Work Area**

**1. Choose mixing location:**

- Dry, clean area (prevents contamination)
- Indoors or under cover (wind can blow biochar dust)
- Near electrode fabrication area (reduces transport of heavy material)
- Good ventilation (biochar dust can be irritating)

**2. Set up containers:**

- Clean mixing container (no residues, no moisture)
- Arrange source containers (wood biochar, Fe-humus biochar) within reach
- Have storage containers ready for final blend

### **Phase 2: Calculate Quantities**

**For 2m³ high-output system with 24 electrodes (from Step 04):**

**Total biochar needed:** ~65-85L prepared blend

**Breakdown by layer (3 layers × 8 electrodes):**

- Layer 1 (8 × 300mm electrodes): 20-25L
- Layer 2 (8 × 300mm electrodes): 20-25L
- Layer 3 (8 × 300mm electrodes): 20-25L
- Reserve (testing, repairs, replacement): 5-10L
- **Total target: 75L** (make 80L for buffer)

**Blend ratio 70:30 by volume:**

- Wood biochar: 70% × 80L = 56L → **Use 55L**
- Fe-humus biochar: 30% × 80L = 24L → **Use 25L**
- **Total: 80L blend**

**Batch strategy (IMPORTANT - don't make all at once):**

- **Batch 1:** 20L (14L wood + 6L Fe-humus) - for first 6-8 electrodes
- **Batch 2:** 20L (14L wood + 6L Fe-humus) - for next 6-8 electrodes
- **Batch 3:** 20L (14L wood + 6L Fe-humus) - for next 6-8 electrodes
- **Batch 4:** 20L (13L wood + 7L Fe-humus) - for final electrodes + reserve
- Test quality after Batch 1 before proceeding

**If measuring by weight (more precise):**

- Wood biochar density: ~0.25-0.35 g/cm³ → 55L = 13.75-19.25kg
- Fe-humus biochar density: ~0.40-0.55 g/cm³ → 25L = 10-13.75kg
- **Weight ratio:** ~60:40 (shifts from 70:30 volume due to Fe-humus density)

**Double-check your available biochar:**

- Do you have 55L wood biochar? (from Step 11 - may need 2-3 pyrolysis sessions)
- Do you have 25L Fe-humus biochar? (from Step 12 - needs 8-12kg humus input)
- If short, produce more biochar in additional batches before blending

### **Phase 3: Blend Materials**

**3. Measure and combine:**

- **Layer method (recommended for even distribution):**
  1. Pour 6L wood biochar into mixing container (first layer)
  2. Pour 2.5L Fe-humus biochar on top (second layer)
  3. Pour 6L wood biochar (third layer)
  4. Pour 2.5L Fe-humus biochar (fourth layer)
  5. Pour 6L wood biochar (fifth layer)
  6. Pour 2L Fe-humus biochar (final layer)
  7. Total: 18L wood + 7L Fe-humus in alternating layers

**4. Mix thoroughly:**

- **Hand mixing (for small batches, <30L):**
  - Reach to bottom with gloved hands
  - Lift lower layers to surface
  - Repeat from different angles
  - 5-10 minutes of active mixing
  - Biochar should look uniform (no visible separation of black wood vs rusty Fe-humus)

- **Shovel mixing (for larger batches, >30L):**
  - Turn pile end-to-end (shovel from one side, flip to other side)
  - Repeat 10-15 times
  - Break up any clumps
  - Final mixture appears homogeneous

- **Tarp mixing (alternative):**
  - Spread biochar on tarp (all layers)
  - Lift corners alternately, roll biochar across tarp
  - Very effective for even blending
  - 5-8 minutes

**5. Verify blend uniformity:**

- Take small handful from 5 different locations in mixed pile
- Each handful should look similar:
  - Mix of black (wood) and rust-brown (Fe-humus) particles
  - No clumps of all-black or all-rust
  - Consistent texture

**6. Magnetic test (optional but reassuring):**

- Pass magnet through handful of blend
- Should attract 20-40% of particles (the Fe-humus fraction)
- If <10% attracted: Fe-humus not well distributed (mix more)
- If >60% attracted: Too much Fe-humus in sample (check ratios)

### **Phase 4: Storage and Labeling**

**7. Transfer to storage containers:**

- Divide blend into manageable portions:
  - 8L for bottom electrode (labeled "Bottom - Large")
  - 3L for middle electrode 1 (labeled "Middle-1 - Medium")
  - 3L for middle electrode 2 (labeled "Middle-2 - Medium")
  - 8L for top electrode (labeled "Top - Large")
  - 3L reserve (labeled "Reserve - Repairs/Testing")

**8. Label containers clearly:**

- Include:
  - Blend ratio (70:30 Wood:Fe-humus)
  - Date prepared
  - Intended electrode (Bottom, Middle, Top)
  - Volume
- Example: "Seigr Hub MFC Biochar Blend | 70:30 | 8L | Bottom Electrode | 2024-XX-XX"

**9. Store properly:**

- Dry location (moisture causes clumping, mold)
- Sealed containers (prevents contamination)
- At fabrication work area (ready for Step 14)
- Shelf life: 6-12 months (longer storage risks moisture absorption, use within one year)

## Quality Verification

**Before using blend in electrodes, confirm:**

### **Visual Homogeneity:**

- Scoop from bottom, middle, top of each container
- Color should be consistent (mix of black + brown)
- No layering visible (indicates poor mixing)

### **Particle Size Distribution:**

- Screen handful through 10mm mesh → <5% retained (no large chunks)
- Screen handful through 2mm mesh → >80% retained (not too much dust)
- Middle fraction (2-10mm) should dominate

### **Conductivity Check (Optional Advanced Test):**

**If you have a multimeter with resistance (Ω) measurement:**

1. Fill small container (10cm × 10cm × 10cm) with blend
2. Insert two copper wires 5cm apart
3. Compress blend lightly (simulates electrode density)
4. Measure resistance between wires
5. **Expected:** 50-200 Ω (indicates good conductivity for biochar mix)
6. **Problem if:** >500 Ω (poor conductivity, check Fe-humus ratio)

### **Magnetic Response:**

- Should feel "tugging" when magnet passes through (Fe particles present)
- Should not clump into solid mass (indicates too much Fe or contamination)

## Blending Variations

**For different applications or adjustments:**

### **High-Conductivity Blend (80:20 Fe-humus:Wood):**

- **Use case:** Cathode electrodes where oxygen reduction is critical
- **Tradeoff:** More brittle, heavier, shorter lifespan (5-7 years vs 7-10 years)
- **Seigr Hub use:** Not recommended for standard build (70:30 is better balance)

### **Longevity Blend (90:10 Wood:Fe-humus):**

- **Use case:** If Fe-humus supply is limited, or prioritizing longest lifespan
- **Tradeoff:** Lower conductivity (10-15% less power output)
- **Seigr Hub use:** Acceptable fallback if Fe-humus collection was insufficient

### **Pure Wood Biochar (100:0):**

- **Use case:** Universal handbook approach (no Fe available)
- **Performance:** Baseline (5-8W per m³)
- **Seigr Hub use:** Only if Fe-humus is completely unavailable (ignores geological advantage)

## Timeline

**Blending process:** 1-2 hours

- Setup and preparation: 15-30 minutes
- Measuring and layering: 20-30 minutes
- Mixing: 15-30 minutes
- Quality verification: 10-15 minutes
- Storage and labeling: 15-20 minutes

## Troubleshooting

**"Fe-humus biochar clumps together, won't blend evenly"**

- May still be slightly moist (dry longer, 1-2 more days)
- Break clumps by hand before mixing
- Or pulse in blender/food processor (breaks clumps into particles)

**"Blend separates after mixing (Fe-humus settles to bottom)"**

- Fe-humus is denser (gravity separation over time)
- Normal if stored for weeks unmixed
- Re-mix immediately before use (30 seconds of stirring)

**"Not enough Fe-humus biochar to make 30%"**

- Use what you have (e.g., 70:20 or 80:15 blends work)
- Note actual ratio on labels (for future reference)
- Accept slightly lower performance (still better than 100% wood)
- Collect more Fe-humus for next system or future electrode replacement

**"Too much Fe-humus biochar (>30%)"**

- Can increase to 70:35 or 65:35 (still acceptable)
- Do NOT exceed 60:40 (structural integrity risk)
- Save excess for future systems or electrode repairs

**"Blend looks dusty (lots of fine particles)"**

- Re-screen through 2mm mesh (remove dust)
- Dust clogs electrode pores, reduces surface area
- Save dust for heavy metal filter layer (Step 10) or compost amendment

**"Magnetic test shows uneven Fe distribution"**

- Mix longer and more vigorously
- Use tarp method (very effective for homogenization)
- Test again after re-mixing

**"Blend smells sour or moldy"**

- Moisture contamination during storage
- Spread out, dry completely in sun (2-3 days)
- If mold is visible (white/green growth), discard and start over (mold indicates wet biochar)

## Important Notes

**Precision matters but perfection isn't required:**

- 70:30 ± 5% is acceptable (i.e., 65:35 to 75:25)
- Microbes and electrons don't demand exact ratios
- Consistency within a batch is more important than hitting exact target

**This blend is unique to Seigr Hub:**

- NGU data revealed high Fe in humus (Step 01)
- We designed biochar production to leverage this (Step 12)
- This blend won't apply to locations without Fe-rich humus
- Document your process (share with Seigr community, help others optimize for their geology)

**Mixing is underrated but critical:**

- Poor mixing = performance variability across electrodes
- Good mixing = consistent, predictable power output
- Take the extra 5-10 minutes to mix thoroughly

**Storage time affects quality:**

- Fresh blend (used within 1 week): Optimal
- Aged blend (1-6 months): Acceptable (may need re-drying if moisture absorbed)
- Old blend (>1 year): Check for moisture, contamination before use

**Safety:**

- Biochar dust can irritate lungs (wear mask if mixing creates dust clouds)
- Gloves prevent skin drying (biochar absorbs oils from skin)
- Eye protection if mixing vigorously (flying particles)

**Biochar blend complete - electrode substrate ready!**

With 65-85L of optimized 70:30 wood:Fe-humus biochar blend prepared (in multiple batches if needed), we have the conductive, high-surface-area material that will form the core of all 24 electrodes in our high-output system. This blend embodies the Seigr Hub geological advantage - a carefully engineered substrate that turns local resources into enhanced electrical performance.

Next: **Step 14 - Fabricate Electrode Quarters** (3D printing or handcrafting the physical electrode structures that will hold this biochar blend).
