# Seigr Hub Cycle Somatic Box - Complete Build Handbook

## Overview

This is the **complete, location-specific handbook** for building a Cycle Somatic Box energy-generating composting system at the **Seigr Hub** Norwegian cabin location.

Unlike the universal handbook, every step here has been optimized using **actual geological survey data** from NGU (Norges Geologiske Undersøkelse) to leverage the unique advantages of our granitic forest terrain.

## What Makes This Special

**Iron-rich humus** → Enhanced biochar conductivity (+140-200%)  
**Manganese nodules** → Superior cathode performance (+30-50%)  
**Mineral groundwater** → Natural electrolyte solution (free)  
**Glacial moraine** → pH buffering without additives  

**Target:** 200-400W continuous output to feed EcoFlow Power Hub via DC-DC charger (supplementing 2×450W solar panels)

## Using This Handbook

### **For Seigr Hub Builders:**

1. Read in sequence (don't skip steps)
2. Each step references previous steps
3. Complete quality checks before proceeding
4. Document your specific observations
5. Adapt to your exact microsite conditions

### **For Other Norwegian Locations:**

1. Access NGU database for your coordinates
2. Compare element profiles to Seigr Hub data
3. Adapt material collection based on what's available
4. Keep general principles, adjust specifics

### **For Non-Norwegian Locations:**

1. Use this as a template for geological adaptation
2. Find your regional geological survey data
3. Identify local advantages (Fe, Mn, Ca sources)
4. Substitute materials while keeping system logic

## Seigr Philosophy Integration

Every step follows these principles:

✅ **Use abundant local materials** - Forest humus, stream minerals, groundwater  
✅ **Minimize external dependencies** - No shipping, no supply chains  
✅ **Work with natural systems** - Leverage geology, ecology, hydrology  
✅ **Design for regeneration** - Harvest sustainably, restore ecosystems  
✅ **Share knowledge openly** - Document everything, help next builder  
✅ **Build for resilience** - Local repair, long lifespan, simple maintenance  

## Expected Performance

**From 1m³ system at Seigr Hub:**

**Energy (optimized multi-unit array):**

- Continuous: 200-400W target
- Daily: 4.8-9.6 kWh
- Annual: 1,750-3,500 kWh
- EcoFlow DC input: Via DC-DC charger (~1600W max capacity)

**Role in Power System:**

- Supplements 2×450W solar panels (900W total)
- 24/7 continuous charging (vs solar's 8-12 hours/day)
- Critical winter backup (when solar drops to 10-20% capacity)
- Battery maintenance during extended dark periods
- Powers computers, appliances, beekeeping machinery, heating via EcoFlow hub
