# Step 08: Build Foundation

## Objective

Construct a stable, well-drained base for your high-output Seigr Hub system that prevents ground contact, manages moisture, and supports structural weight for 7-10 years.

**Scale for high-output system:** This step builds foundation for one 2m³ unit (1.6m × 1.6m footprint). For modular array (2-4 units), build foundations adjacent or in line for easy interconnection.

## Why This Matters

**The foundation serves critical functions:**

- **Structural support** - Distributes 800-1200kg system weight across soil (2m³ unit vs 400-600kg for 1m³)
- **Moisture management** - Prevents waterlogging from ground saturation
- **Drainage** - Channels leachate away from active compost zone
- **Insulation** - Thermal break from frozen ground in winter
- **Pest barrier** - Elevates system above ground-dwelling rodents
- **Access** - Positions system at working height for maintenance

**A failed foundation means:**

- Settling and tilting (electrodes shift, connections break)
- Waterlogging (anaerobic conditions, low power, bad smell)
- Frost heave in winter (cracks walls, displaces electrodes)
- Short lifespan (3-4 years instead of 7-10)

**Site conditions at Seigr Hub:**

- Glacial moraine soil (good drainage potential)
- Frost depth ~50-80cm in winter
- Seasonal water table fluctuation
- Forest floor (roots, organic matter, some stability challenges)

## Foundation Design

### **Type: Post-and-Beam Elevated Platform**

**Why this design:**

- Raises system 15-20cm above ground (drainage + airflow)
- Easy to build with reclaimed wood
- Minimal ground disturbance (Seigr low-impact philosophy)
- Natural materials fit forest setting
- Can adjust for site irregularities

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Concrete pad:** Permanent, stable, but high embodied energy, not reclaimed
- **Gravel bed:** Simpler, but no elevation (waterlogging risk)
- **Pallet platform:** Fast, but pallets decay in 2-3 years
- **Stone piers:** Very durable, but requires more excavation

**Post-and-beam wins for:** Sustainability + longevity + site adaptability

### **Dimensions:**

**Footprint:**

- 1.8m × 1.8m (larger than system 1.6m × 1.6m)
- 10cm overhang on all sides (working space, stability)
- For 2m³ high-output unit with 24 electrodes

**Height:**

- 15-20cm above ground level
- Enough for airflow, drainage access
- Low enough for safe loading (waist-height access to top)

**Load capacity:**

- 2m³ system weight: ~1000kg when full (biochar, compost, moisture, wood, 24 electrodes)
- Safety factor: 2× = design for 2000kg
- 4 posts = 500kg per post (requires 12cm × 12cm timber minimum)
- 6 posts option: 333kg each = 10cm × 10cm timber sufficient

## Materials Needed

**From forest/property (reclaimed or harvested):**

1. **Post foundation (4 pieces):**
   - Rot-resistant wood (larch, pine heartwood, cedar if available)
   - 50cm long, 10cm × 10cm minimum
   - Will be buried 30cm, 20cm exposed
   - Can substitute: Large stones (30cm+ diameter), concrete blocks

2. **Beams (4 pieces):**
   - 1.9m long, 12cm × 12cm (larger for higher load)
   - Form square frame on top of posts
   - Can use: Reclaimed lumber, storm-felled trees milled on-site

3. **Joists (8-10 pieces):**
   - 1.8m long, 6cm × 12cm
   - Span across beams to support deck
   - Spaced 18-22cm apart (tighter for heavier load)

4. **Decking (30-40 pieces):**
   - 1.8m long, 2cm × 15cm boards
   - Form platform surface
   - Gaps between boards allow drainage, airflow

**Purchased/salvaged materials:**

5. **Gravel (drainage):**
   - 80-120L (0.08-0.12m³)
   - 20-40mm clean stone
   - For post hole drainage (4-6 holes, deeper for heavier system)

6. **Wood preservative (optional but recommended):**
   - Linseed oil or tung oil (natural, non-toxic)
   - Or biochar tar (from pyrolysis process, Step 11/12)
   - Coat buried portion of posts

7. **Fasteners:**
   - Deck screws: 50-100 pieces, 75-100mm length (galvanized or stainless)
   - Or: Wooden pegs (traditional, more work, very sustainable)
   - Metal corner brackets: 4 pieces (optional, adds rigidity)

**Tools required:**

- Shovel or post-hole digger
- Saw (hand saw or chainsaw for cutting wood)
- Drill with bits (for pre-drilling screw holes)
- Level (2-4 foot length, checks horizontal)
- Measuring tape
- Pencil or chalk (marking cuts)
- Square (checks 90° angles)

## Construction Process

### **Phase 1: Site Preparation**

**1. Clear and level the area:**

- From Step 03, you marked 3m × 3m zone (system + working space)
- Clear vegetation, roots, rocks from center 1.8m × 1.8m
- Remove organic topsoil layer (5-10cm) - set aside for later use
- Level surface roughly (doesn't need to be perfect, posts will adjust)

**2. Mark post locations:**

- Four corners of 1.8m × 1.8m square
- Measure diagonals (should be equal = ~2.12m) to ensure square
- Mark with stakes or stones

**3. Dig post holes:**

- 30-40cm deep at each corner
- 15cm diameter (slightly larger than posts)
- Deeper than frost line is ideal but not critical for lightweight system
- Set aside excavated soil

### **Phase 2: Install Posts**

**4. Add drainage gravel:**

- 5-10cm gravel at bottom of each hole
- Tamp down with stick or post end
- Prevents water pooling around buried post (rot prevention)

**5. Treat posts (if using wood preservative):**

- Coat bottom 30cm of each post with linseed oil or biochar tar
- Let absorb 30-60 minutes
- Especially important for cut end grain (most vulnerable to rot)

**6. Set posts in holes:**

- Place one post in each hole, centered
- Backfill with excavated soil + extra gravel mix
- Tamp firmly every 10cm of fill (use stick or board)
- Leave posts 5-10cm higher than final height (will trim later)

**7. Level post tops:**

- Place long level across two posts
- Adjust height by adding soil under low post or tamping down high post
- Check all four pairs (N-S, E-W, both diagonals)
- Posts should form level plane (±1cm tolerance)

**8. Mark final height:**

- Measure 20cm above ground at one post
- Use level to transfer height to other posts
- Mark with pencil
- Cut posts to marks with saw

### **Phase 3: Build Frame**

**9. Attach beams to posts:**

- Lay one beam across two posts (forming one side)
- Beam sits on top of posts
- Overhang equal on both ends (~10cm each side)
- Pre-drill holes to prevent splitting
- Attach with two screws per post (100mm length, angled down into post)
- Repeat for opposite side, then two remaining sides

**10. Check for square:**

- Measure diagonals again (now including beams)
- Should still be equal
- If not, gently rack frame until square
- Tighten screws fully once square

**11. Add corner bracing (optional but recommended):**

- Metal corner brackets inside each joint
- Or cut diagonal braces (wood blocks at 45°) and screw in place
- Prevents frame from racking over time

### **Phase 4: Install Joists and Decking**

**12. Position joists:**

- Lay joists across beams, perpendicular
- Space evenly: 6 joists = ~25cm spacing, 8 joists = ~20cm spacing
- Flush with outer edge of frame
- Attach with two screws at each end (into beams)

**13. Lay decking boards:**

- Position first board flush with one edge of frame
- Attach to each joist (one screw per joist crossing)
- Leave 5-10mm gap to next board (drainage, expansion)
- Continue across platform
- Cut final board to fit if needed

**14. Trim overhangs if necessary:**

- If deck boards extend past frame, trim flush with saw
- Or leave overhang (can be useful for gripping/moving system later)

**15. Final surface check:**

- Walk on platform (should feel solid, no wobble)
- Check level again (place level on surface, should be close to horizontal)
- Adjust joist height if major irregularities (remove screws, add shims, re-attach)

## Drainage Layer Integration

**On top of completed platform:**

### **16. Add geotextile fabric (optional but helpful):**

- Landscape fabric or burlap (prevents fine particles clogging drainage)
- Cut to 1.6m × 1.6m (size of system footprint)
- Lay over deck boards
- Not necessary but extends drainage function

### **17. Add coarse gravel layer:**

- 20-30L of 10-20mm clean stone
- Spread evenly over fabric/deck area
- 5-10cm depth
- This is the bottom drainage layer of the MFC system itself

**Foundation is now ready for wall construction!**

## Quality Checks

After completing this step, you should have:

✅ **Platform is level** (check with level, ±1cm)  
✅ **Posts are stable** (no wobble when you push on frame)  
✅ **Frame is square** (equal diagonals)  
✅ **Deck is solid** (walk on it, no sagging or flexing)  
✅ **Height is correct** (15-20cm above ground)  
✅ **Drainage layer installed** (gravel spread evenly)  
✅ **Tools and materials cleaned up** (organized work site)  

## Timeline

**Foundation construction:** 1-2 days

- Site prep: 2-3 hours
- Post installation: 2-3 hours
- Frame and deck: 3-5 hours
- Drainage layer: 30 minutes
- (Assumes solo work; with helper can be done in one day)

## Troubleshooting

**"Ground is very uneven (rocks, roots, slope)"**

- Use longer posts on downhill side to level platform
- Maximum post height difference: 50cm (beyond this, consider terracing or different site)
- Notch posts around large roots if can't remove
- Fill low spots with gravel before setting posts

**"Posts wobble even after tamping"**

- Add more gravel/soil and tamp harder (really pack it down)
- Or pour small amount of concrete around post (mix 1:2:3 cement:sand:gravel)
- Or cross-brace posts below deck level (diagonal braces between posts)

**"Don't have rot-resistant wood for posts"**

- Char exterior of posts (burn surface black, creates carbon shield)
- Or use stones/concrete blocks instead of buried wood posts
- Or accept 5-7 year lifespan and plan to replace posts mid-life

**"Platform tilts after loading with weight"**

- Check which post settled - probably insufficient tamping
- Unload system (if already built)
- Jack up frame on that corner
- Add more gravel/soil under post, tamp very firmly
- Lower frame back down and recheck level

**"Budget very limited - can I skip elevated platform?"**

- Yes, can build directly on gravel bed at ground level
- Must ensure site has natural drainage (slope away from system)
- Increase drainage gravel depth to 15-20cm
- Risk: Waterlogging in wet season, frost heave in winter
- Monitor more carefully and be ready to add drainage if problems

**"Can I use pallets instead of building frame?"**

- Yes, but choose Euro pallets (treated, more durable) or hardwood pallets
- Stack two pallets for height (15-20cm)
- Lifespan only 3-5 years (vs 7-10 for proper foundation)
- Ensure pallets are level and stable

## Seasonal Considerations

**Building in different seasons:**

**Spring:**

- Ground may be wet/soft - harder to dig, but easier to drive posts
- Wait until frost is fully out of ground (May-June in Norway)
- Good season - moderate temps, long days

**Summer:**

- Dry, hard ground - more effort to dig post holes
- Best weather for wood treatment (oils absorb well, dry fast)
- Optimal season for foundation work

**Fall:**

- Ground softening as rains return
- Must complete before frost sets in (October-November)
- Rush to finish before snow

**Winter:**

- Frozen ground - cannot dig post holes
- Can prepare materials (cut wood, drill holes indoors)
- Wait for spring to install

## Maintenance

**Annual inspection:**

- Check post stability (push on frame, should not wobble)
- Inspect wood for rot, insect damage (replace if necessary)
- Clear debris from beneath platform (airflow maintenance)
- Re-level if settling occurred (jack up corner, add support)

**5-year maintenance:**

- Replace deck boards if showing rot (top surface most exposed)
- Re-coat posts with preservative if accessible
- Check fasteners (tighten or replace rusted screws)

**Expected lifespan:**

- Posts: 10-15 years (if treated, rot-resistant wood)
- Frame/joists: 10-20 years (above ground, drier)
- Decking: 7-12 years (most exposed, may need replacement)

## Important Notes

**Foundation is the most permanent part:**

- Everything else can be modified, rebuilt, improved
- A good foundation allows long-term system evolution
- Worth investing time to do well

**Over-engineer slightly:**

- Better too strong than too weak
- Extra lumber is minimal cost/effort
- Failure during operation is major disruption

**Site integration:**

- Foundation should look like it belongs in the forest
- Use local, natural materials
- Minimalist design (just what's needed, no more)
- After one year, moss/lichen will colonize (natural camouflage)

**This step connects to NGU geology:**

- Moraine soil beneath provides excellent drainage (glacial legacy)
- Frost depth data (not in NGU dataset, but regional knowledge) informs post depth
- Foundation separates system from ground moisture dynamics

**Foundation complete - structural stability secured!**

With a level, stable platform in place, we can now build the vertical walls that will contain our biogeochemical reactor. The foundation's drainage integration sets the stage for optimal moisture management throughout the system's life.

Next: **Step 09 - Construct Walls** (building the containment structure for our engineered compost ecosystem).
