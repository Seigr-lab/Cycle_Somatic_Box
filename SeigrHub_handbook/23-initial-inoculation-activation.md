# Step 23: Initial Microbial Inoculation and System Activation

## Objective

Introduce specific electrochemically-active bacteria (EAB) to electrodes and establish optimal conditions for microbial colonization, launching the 2-4 week activation period that transforms the compost system into an electricity-generating bioelectrical reactor.

**For high-output system:** Proper inoculation can reduce activation time from 4-8 weeks (natural colonization) to 2-4 weeks (targeted inoculation), and increase final output 20-40% through optimal microbial community establishment.

## Why This Matters

**Electricity generation requires specific microbes:**

- **Not all bacteria generate electricity** - Most compost microbes are not electrochemically active
- **Electrochemically-active bacteria (EAB)** use electrodes as electron acceptors (instead of O₂)
- **Key genera:** *Geobacter*, *Shewanella*, *Pseudomonas*, *Clostridium* (fermentative)
- **Natural colonization:** 4-12 weeks (slow, unpredictable)
- **Targeted inoculation:** 2-4 weeks (faster, more consistent)

**Without proper inoculation:**

- System may take 8-12 weeks to reach peak output
- Microbial community may be dominated by non-EAB (low power)
- Inconsistent performance (20-100W variation)

**With targeted inoculation:**

- Activation in 2-4 weeks
- Higher proportion of EAB on electrodes
- More stable, predictable output (closer to design 200-400W target)

**For 1-person cabin with computers/machinery/heating:**

- Faster activation = sooner power contribution
- Reliable output = can plan EcoFlow charging schedule

## Understanding Electrochemically-Active Bacteria (EAB)

### **What Are EAB:**

**Bacteria that can transfer electrons to external conductors (electrodes):**

**Mechanism 1: Direct electron transfer (DET)**

- Bacteria attach to electrode surface
- Use outer membrane cytochromes (proteins with iron centers)
- Electrons flow directly from cell to electrode
- **Key organisms:** *Geobacter sulfurreducens*, *Geobacter metallireducens*
- **Optimal conditions:** Anaerobic, pH 6-8, 25-35°C, organic carbon source

**Mechanism 2: Mediated electron transfer (MET)**

- Bacteria excrete soluble molecules (mediators)
- Mediators shuttle electrons from cell to electrode
- **Key organisms:** *Shewanella oneidensis*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
- **Optimal conditions:** Microaerobic to anaerobic, pH 6-8, 20-40°C

**Mechanism 3: Nanowire transfer**

- Some EAB produce conductive pili (nanowires)
- Form networks across biofilm
- Enable long-distance electron transfer
- **Key organisms:** *Geobacter* species, some *Shewanella*

### **Where to Find EAB:**

**Natural sources rich in EAB:**

**1. Anaerobic sediments (best source):**

- Lake/pond bottom mud (black, reduced, smells of sulfide)
- Stream/river sediments in slow-flow areas
- Marine sediments (if coastal access)
- **Why rich:** Low O₂ = bacteria evolved to use alternative electron acceptors (including metals, electrodes)
- **For Norwegian context:** Your stream (from Steps 02, 06) likely has suitable sediment

**2. Wetland/bog soils:**

- Peat bogs (anaerobic zones)
- Wetland edges (waterlogged soil)
- **Why rich:** Permanently reduced conditions, organic matter abundant

**3. Compost (secondary source):**

- Aged compost (6+ months)
- Interior of compost pile (anaerobic core)
- **Why less ideal:** Mixed community, lower EAB proportion (but some present)

**4. Wastewater treatment sludge:**

- Anaerobic digester sludge (if accessible from municipal treatment plant)
- **Why excellent:** Selected for anaerobic metabolism, high EAB density
- **Accessibility:** May require permission, safety concerns (pathogens)

**5. Commercial microbial inoculants:**

- MFC-specific cultures (available from research suppliers)
- **Cost:** €50-200 per sample
- **Pros:** Known composition, high EAB concentration
- **Cons:** Expensive, not local, not Seigr-aligned

**Recommendation for Norwegian cabin:**

- **Primary source:** Stream sediment (from your geological survey area)
- **Secondary source:** Forest wetland soil or bog peat
- **Tertiary source:** Aged compost from system itself (after 2-4 weeks of natural colonization)

### **EAB Colonization Process:**

**Week 0-1: Attachment**

- Bacteria from inoculant reach electrodes (via water flow, diffusion)
- Adsorb to biochar surface (high surface area = more attachment sites)
- Begin forming biofilm (excrete extracellular polymers)

**Week 1-2: Growth and biofilm formation**

- Attached cells reproduce (doubling time 4-12 hours for *Geobacter*)
- Biofilm thickens (10-100 µm)
- Community composition shifts (EAB outcompete non-EAB at electrode surface)

**Week 2-3: Electrical connection establishment**

- Cytochromes fully expressed (bacteria "realize" electrode is present)
- Electron transfer pathways activate
- Measurable current begins (initially low, 10-30% of final)

**Week 3-4: Maturation**

- Biofilm reaches stable thickness (100-300 µm)
- Maximum EAB density at electrode interface
- Current plateaus (80-100% of final output)

**Week 4+: Maintenance**

- Continuous turnover (cells die, new cells grow)
- Stable community if conditions maintained
- Output stable (±10-20% variation)

- **Buckets:** Transport sediment, mix inoculant
- **Gloves:** Handle sediment (may contain pathogens - wash hands after)
- **Measuring cups/scale:** Portion nutrients accurately
- **Funnel:** Pour solutions

## Inoculation Process

### **Phase 1: Collect Microbial Inoculant (2-4 hours)**

**1. Identify collection site:**

**Stream sediment (your geological survey area):**

- Return to stream where you collected Mn nodules (Step 06)
- Look for:
  - Slow-flow areas (eddies, pool margins)
  - Black sediment visible (reduced, anaerobic)
  - Organic matter accumulation (leaves, wood)
  - Depth: 20-50cm water (can wade in)

**2. Collect sediment:**

- Use shovel to scoop sediment from 5-15cm below surface
  - **Top 0-5cm:** Usually oxidized (brown), skip this
  - **5-15cm depth:** Black, reduced, smells of sulfide (this is target)
- Fill bucket with 2-5kg sediment (wet weight)
- **Safety:** Wear gloves, avoid ingestion, wash hands after

**3. Optional secondary source (wetland soil):**

- If accessible: Collect 1-3kg peat or wetland soil
- Dig from waterlogged zone (permanently reduced)
- Adds diversity to inoculant

**4. Transport to system:**

- Keep sediment cool (don't leave in hot sun)
- Use within 24 hours (bacteria start dying after collection)
- Or: Store at 4°C (refrigerator) for up to 1 week

### **Phase 2: Prepare Inoculant Slurry (1 hour)**

**5. Mix sediment with water:**

- In large bucket (20-30L), combine:
  - 2-5kg sediment (collected)
  - 10-15L water (rainwater or filtered water preferred, not chlorinated)
- Stir thoroughly (breaks up clumps, suspends bacteria)
- **Result:** Brown-black slurry (consistency of thin mud)

**6. Add nutrient amendments:**

**Carbon source:**

- **Sodium acetate:** 10-20g dissolved in 1L water, add to slurry
  - **Final concentration:** ~1-2 g/L acetate (10-20 mM)
- **Glucose:** 10-20g, add to slurry
  - **Final concentration:** ~1-2 g/L glucose

**Nitrogen source:**

- **Yeast extract:** 5-10g, add to slurry
  - **Final concentration:** ~0.5 g/L

**Mix well** (all nutrients dissolved)

**7. pH check and adjustment:**

- Test slurry pH with strip or meter
- **Target:** 6.5-7.5
- **If <6.5 (acidic):** Add sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), 5-10g at a time, retest
- **If >8.0 (too alkaline):** Add small amount of vinegar or citric acid (rare)

**8. Let settle briefly (optional):**

- Allow 10-15 minutes settling
- Coarse sand/gravel settles to bottom
- Pour off liquid layer (contains suspended bacteria, fine particles)
- Discard heavy sediment (reduces clogging when applying)

### **Phase 3: Apply Inoculant to System (1-2 hours)**

**9. Prepare system for inoculation:**

- **Open lid** (from Step 21)
- **Check surface moisture:**
  - Should be moist (50-60%)
  - If dry: Pre-moisten with 10-20L water, wait 30 minutes for absorption

**10. Apply inoculant slurry evenly:**

**Method A: Watering can distribution**

- Fill watering can with inoculant slurry (pour from bucket)
- Sprinkle evenly across entire system surface (1.6m × 1.6m = 2.56m²)
- **Target depth:** 1-2L per m² = 3-5L total applied
- Moves slowly across surface (don't create puddles)

**Method B: Pump sprayer**

- Fill pump sprayer with liquid portion of slurry (strain out large particles)
- Spray in overlapping pattern
- Deeper penetration than watering can

**11. Target electrode zones specifically:**

**If you know electrode positions (marked in Step 19):**

- Apply extra slurry directly above each electrode location (especially anodes)
- Pour 200-500ml per electrode (24 electrodes × 300ml = 7-8L additional)
- Inoculant flows down, reaches electrode surfaces

**Why:** Direct contact speeds colonization

**12. Massage slurry into surface:**

- After application, gently rake or stir top 5-10cm of compost
- Helps inoculant penetrate deeper
- Don't disturb electrode positions

### **Phase 4: Add Nutrient Solution (Ongoing Feeding)**

**13. Prepare enriched nutrient solution:**

**Recipe for 10L batch (weekly addition for first month):**

- Water: 10L (rainwater preferred)
- Sodium acetate: 15-20g (1.5-2 g/L)
- Glucose: 10-15g (1-1.5 g/L)
- Yeast extract: 5g (0.5 g/L)
- Sodium bicarbonate: 5g (pH buffer)
- Epsom salt: 2g (Mg source)

**Dissolve all components** in warm water, stir well

**14. Apply nutrient solution:**

- **Week 1:** Apply 5-10L nutrient solution to system
  - Distributes evenly across surface
  - Percolates down to electrodes
- **Week 2:** Repeat (5-10L)
- **Week 3:** Repeat (5-10L)
- **Week 4:** Reduce to 3-5L (system is self-sustaining by now)

**Why weekly feeding:**

- Maintains high carbon availability during colonization
- EAB can grow rapidly with abundant food
- After week 4, compost organic matter provides continuous carbon (no more additions needed)

### **Phase 5: Optimize Environmental Conditions (Ongoing, 4 weeks)**

**15. Temperature management:**

**Target: 25-40°C (optimal for most EAB)**

**Check internal temperature daily** (probe thermometer via port from Step 21):

- **If <20°C (too cold):**
  - Increase insulation (more straw bales)
  - Reduce vent openings (retain heat)
  - Add fresh organic matter (restart composting heat)
  - Wait for warmer weather (spring/summer activation ideal)

- **If 25-40°C (optimal):**
  - Maintain current conditions
  - No action needed

- **If >60°C (too hot):**
  - Increase ventilation (cool down)
  - Reduce composting activity (add less fresh nitrogen)
  - **Risk:** Thermophilic temperatures kill mesophilic EAB

**Most EAB are mesophilic (optimal 25-40°C):**

- Some thermophilic EAB exist (can work at 50-60°C)
- But majority prefer moderate temperatures
- **For Norwegian climate:** 20-35°C likely range (good)

**16. Moisture management:**

**Target: 55-65% moisture content**

**Check weekly (squeeze test):**

- Grab handful of compost from top 10cm
- Squeeze tightly:
  - **Optimal:** Holds shape, releases 1-3 drops water
  - **Too dry (<50%):** Crumbles, no moisture
  - **Too wet (>70%):** Water drips freely

**Adjust as needed:**

- **Too dry:** Add 10-20L water (via nutrient solution or plain water)
- **Too wet:** Improve drainage, reduce additions, aerate top layer

**17. pH monitoring:**

**Target: 6.5-7.5 (neutral)**

**Check weekly (leachate sample from Step 22 or surface grab sample):**

- **If <6.0 (acidic):**
  - Add 200-500g wood ash to surface, mix into top 10cm
  - Or: Add sodium bicarbonate solution (50-100g in 5L water)
  - Retest in 2-3 days

- **If >8.0 (too alkaline):**
  - Rare in composting systems
  - May indicate excessive moraine buffer
  - Add acidic materials (peat, coffee grounds)

**18. Aeration balance:**

**Critical challenge: Anodes need low O₂, cathodes need high O₂**

**Stratification helps (from Step 20):**

- Lower layers (anodes): Naturally more anaerobic (deeper, compacted)
- Upper layers (cathodes): More aerobic (surface ventilation)

**Vent management:**

- **Week 1-2:** Keep vents partially closed (retain heat, establish anaerobic zones)
- **Week 3-4:** Open vents more (supply O₂ to cathodes as biofilm forms)
- **Ongoing:** Adjust seasonally (more open in summer, less in winter)

**Monitor oxygen indirectly:**

- **Odor:** Slight earthy/ammonia = good; strong sulfide (rotten egg) = too anaerobic throughout
- **Leachate color:** Light to medium brown = good; very dark black = highly reduced (very anaerobic)

### **Phase 6: Monitor Activation Progress (Daily/Weekly, 4 weeks)**

**19. Electrical measurements (track activation):**

**Equipment:**

- Multimeter (from earlier steps)
- Test leads with alligator clips

**Measurement points:**

- **Anode wire** (from Step 19 wire bundle)
- **Cathode wire** (from same bundle)
- Measure voltage and current between one anode-cathode pair

**Week 0 (immediately after inoculation):**

- **Open circuit voltage (OCV):** 0.1-0.3V (baseline, little activity)
- **Short circuit current (SCC):** 0-5 mA (minimal)

**Week 1:**

- **OCV:** 0.2-0.4V (slight increase)
- **SCC:** 5-15 mA (biofilm starting)

**Week 2:**

- **OCV:** 0.3-0.5V
- **SCC:** 15-40 mA (clear growth)

**Week 3:**

- **OCV:** 0.4-0.6V
- **SCC:** 40-80 mA (rapid rise as biofilm matures)

**Week 4:**

- **OCV:** 0.5-0.7V (approaching plateau)
- **SCC:** 80-150 mA (nearing final output)

**Week 4+:**

- **OCV:** 0.5-0.8V (stable)
- **SCC:** 100-200 mA per electrode pair (mature system)

**If progress is slower:**

- Temperature too low (warm system)
- pH out of range (adjust)
- Insufficient carbon (add more acetate)
- Poor inoculant (try different source)

**20. Visual inspection (weekly):**

- Open small access hatch (from Step 21)
- Look for:
  - **Biofilm on exposed electrode wires:** Slimy, gray-black coating (good sign)
  - **Color change around electrodes:** Darker zones near anodes (reduction), lighter near cathodes (oxidation)
  - **No mold or fungal growth:** Suggests good moisture, not too wet
  - **No insect infestation:** Lid seal working

**21. Temperature tracking:**

- Record daily (same time each day)
- **Expected pattern:**
  - Week 1-2: May rise (composting restarts from fresh moisture/nutrients)
  - Week 2-3: Plateau (40-50°C typical)
  - Week 3-4: May drop slightly (initial burst ends, stabilizes)

**22. Leachate monitoring:**

- Continue from Step 22 (volume, pH, color)
- **Changes during activation:**
  - pH may drop slightly (microbial acid production), then stabilize
  - Color darkens (dissolved organics), then lightens (organics consumed)
  - Volume may increase (added water from nutrients), then normalize

## Expected Results

**After 2-4 weeks of activation:**

**Electrical characteristics:**

- **Open circuit voltage (OCV):** 0.5-0.8V per electrode pair
- **Short circuit current (SCC):** 100-200 mA per electrode pair
- **Power output (single pair):** 20-50 mW (V × I = 0.6V × 100mA = 60mW)
- **Total system (24 electrodes = 12 anode-cathode pairs):** 1-3W initial (will increase to 10-30W per unit after full maturation in 2-3 months)

**Microbial indicators:**
✅ **Biofilm visible** on electrode surfaces (slimy, dark coating)
✅ **Temperature stable** (35-50°C maintained)
✅ **pH neutral** (6.5-7.5 range)
✅ **Moisture optimal** (55-65%, squeeze test passes)
✅ **No foul odors** (earthy smell, not sulfide)
✅ **Electrical output increasing** week-over-week (clear trend)

**System is considered "activated" when:**

- Voltage readings plateau (no longer increasing rapidly)
- Current is >80% of expected final output
- Biofilm is visibly established
- Typically 2-4 weeks for inoculated systems, 4-8 weeks for natural colonization

## Troubleshooting

**"No voltage detected after 2 weeks"**

- **Wiring issue:** Check all connections, verify continuity
- **Electrodes not in contact with compost:** Verify they didn't shift during filling
- **Too dry:** Add water (bacteria need moisture for metabolism and ion transport)
- **Wrong pH:** Test and adjust to 6.5-7.5
- **Temperature too low:** Warm system (increase insulation, wait for warmer weather)

**"Voltage is very low (<0.2V after 3 weeks)"**

- **Insufficient EAB in inoculant:** Try different sediment source (more reduced, blacker)
- **Carbon limitation:** Add more acetate or glucose (increase feeding)
- **Cathode O₂ limitation:** Increase ventilation (cathodes need oxygen)
- **Competing metabolisms:** Too much oxygen reaching anodes (they should be anaerobic) - reduce vents

**"Voltage started high, then dropped"**

- **Initial burst from easily-degradable organics, then crash**
- **Solution:** Continue feeding (weekly nutrient additions), give more time (biofilm needs 3-4 weeks)
- **Or: pH crashed (acids accumulated)** - Add buffer (sodium bicarbonate)

**"Current is high but voltage is low"**

- **Internal resistance too high** (poor electrode conductivity, dry compost)
- **Check:** Moisture (add water), electrode connections (verify <10Ω), biochar quality

**"System smells like rotten eggs (sulfide)"**

- **Too anaerobic throughout** (cathodes not getting O₂)
- **Increase ventilation** immediately
- **Add coarse material** to top layer (wood chips) - improves airflow
- **Check drainage** (waterlogging causes this)

**"Mold growing on surface"**

- **Too wet** (reduce moisture)
- **Normal in compost** to some extent (fungal activity)
- **If excessive:** Aerate, add dry bulking agents (straw)

**"Temperature dropped below 20°C and output is very low"**

- **Cold-weather challenge** (Norwegian winter)
- **Solutions:**
  - Wait for spring (natural activation in warmer months)
  - Add more insulation (retain any heat generated)
  - Move system indoors (if small enough) - not feasible for 2m³ unit
  - Accept slow activation (may take 6-8 weeks in cold)
  - Add fresh nitrogen source (restart composting heat) - grass clippings, food waste

**"Activation seems complete but output is lower than expected (5-10W vs 20-30W)"**

- **Normal for first month** - Full output takes 2-3 months as biofilm matures fully
- **Continue monitoring** - Should gradually increase
- **Check:** All 24 electrodes connected and working (test each pair individually)

## Connection to Next Steps

**Step 23 outputs (activated system) enable:**

**→ Step 24 (Optimize Performance):**

- Baseline electrical data from activation monitoring informs optimization
- Identify underperforming electrodes for targeted fixes
