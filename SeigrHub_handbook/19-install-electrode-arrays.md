# Step 19: Install Electrode Arrays in System

## Objective

Position 24 loaded electrodes in three vertical layers within the 2m³ system, creating the spatial architecture for high-output microbial fuel cell operation.

**Scale for high-output system:** This step installs 8 electrodes per layer (4 cathodes + 4 anodes) at 50cm, 90cm, and 120cm depths, with precise spacing for optimal electron flow and organic matter distribution.

## Why This Matters

**Electrode positioning determines system performance:**
- **Layer spacing** - Vertical separation creates electrical potential gradients
- **Horizontal spacing** - Lateral distance affects current distribution and organic matter access
- **Cathode placement** - Must be in oxygen-rich zones (top, edges, water flow paths)
- **Anode placement** - Must be in organic-rich zones (bottom, center, drainage paths)
- **Wire management** - Organized routing prevents tangles, shorts, disconnections

**Poor positioning causes:**
- Electrode interference (too close = competing for same microbes)
- Dead zones (too far = electrons can't flow between layers)
- Oxygen depletion (all cathodes in anaerobic areas = low performance)
- Wire damage (pinched, stressed, corroded connections fail early)
- System output: 40-60% of potential

**For 24-electrode high-output system:**
- Proper spacing enables 200-400W target
- Each misplaced electrode = 5-15W loss
- Wire management failures = complete layer shutdown (60-120W loss!)

## Understanding the Tri-Layer Architecture

### **Layer 1: Bottom Layer (50cm depth from system base)**

**Function:** Primary anode zone + drainage cathodes

**Composition:**
- 4 anodes (E13, E14, E15, E16) - Center positions
- 4 cathodes (E1, E2, E3, E4) - Peripheral positions

**Why at 50cm:**
- Above drainage layer (25-35cm) - prevents waterlogging
- Below main compost mass - receives drainage (organic acids, nutrients)
- Gravity feeds organics downward to anodes
- Cathodes at layer edges access O₂ from lateral airflow

**Electrode spacing (top view):**
```
    [C1]           [C2]
        [A13] [A14]
        [A15] [A16]
    [C3]           [C4]
```
- Cathodes at corners: 30cm from walls
- Anodes at center: 40-45cm from walls
- Center-to-center: 400mm (spacing from Step 04 design)

### **Layer 2: Middle Layer (90cm depth from system base)**

**Function:** Balanced anode/cathode zone, highest microbial activity

**Composition:**
- 4 anodes (E17, E18, E19, E20)
- 4 cathodes (E5, E6, E7, E8)

**Why at 90cm:**
- Center of compost mass - peak temperature (55-65°C)
- Maximum microbial activity (thermophilic bacteria)
- Equal distance from top and bottom (40cm to each) - balanced gradients
- Offset from Layer 1 by 40cm - creates vertical electron flow

**Electrode spacing (top view, offset from Layer 1):**
```
        [C5] [C6]
    [A17]       [A18]
    [A19]       [A20]
        [C7] [C8]
```
- Rotated 45° from Layer 1 pattern (prevents direct stacking)
- Same 400mm center-to-center spacing

### **Layer 3: Top Layer (120cm depth = 5cm below surface)**

**Function:** Maximum cathode oxygen access + surface anode activity

**Composition:**
- 4 anodes (E21, E22, E23, E24)
- 4 cathodes (E9, E10, E11, E12)

**Why at 120cm (near surface):**
- Cathodes access atmospheric O₂ (highest oxygen concentration)
- Anodes process fresh organic inputs (food waste, new material)
- Vertical distance from Layer 1: 70cm (strong electrical gradient)
- Distance from Layer 2: 30cm (intermediate gradient)

**Electrode spacing (top view, aligned with Layer 1):**
```
    [C9]           [C10]
        [A21] [A22]
        [A23] [A24]
    [C11]          [C12]
```
- Same pattern as Layer 1 (stacking creates vertical current paths)

## Materials and Tools Needed

### **From Previous Steps:**

**Loaded electrodes (Step 18):**
- Layer 1: E1-E4 (cathodes), E13-E16 (anodes) - 8 total
- Layer 2: E5-E8 (cathodes), E17-E20 (anodes) - 8 total

- Wire cutters (trim cable ties)
- Pliers (tighten turnbuckles, bend wire)
- Marker/chalk (mark wall positions)
- Level (verify horizontal layers)
- Tape measure (spacing verification)
- Scissors (cut mesh if needed)

## Installation Process

### **Phase 1: Prepare System and Mark Positions (45-60 minutes)**

**1. Verify drainage layer:**
- System should have completed drainage installation (Step 10)
- Check: Moraine buffer layer is level, ~10cm depth
- Check: Landscape fabric is in place over moraine
- If drainage not complete: Finish Step 10 first

**2. Mark layer heights on walls:**
- Measure from system base (foundation deck)
- **Layer 1 mark:** 50cm height
- **Layer 2 mark:** 90cm height
- **Layer 3 mark:** 120cm height
- Mark on all 4 walls (internal surface)
- Use level to ensure marks are horizontal
- Draw horizontal lines connecting marks (creates reference grid)

**3. Mark electrode positions on walls:**

**For Layer 1 (50cm height):**
- Cathode positions: 30cm from corners
- Anode positions: Center area (60-80cm from walls)
- Mark 8 positions total on the 50cm height line
- Label: "C1", "C2", "C3", "C4", "A13", "A14", "A15", "A16"

**Repeat for Layers 2 and 3** (at 90cm and 120cm heights)
- Use offset pattern for Layer 2
- Use same pattern as Layer 1 for Layer 3

**4. Install layer support structures:**

**If using wire mesh shelves:**
- Cut mesh to 1.55m × 1.55m (fits inside 1.6m walls with 2.5cm clearance)
- Mark mesh with electrode positions (use paint or wire ties)
- Set aside - will install layer-by-layer

**If using wooden slat grids:**
- Cut slats to 1.55m length
- Assemble grids: 8 slats per grid (4 parallel, 4 perpendicular, 20cm spacing)
- Attach with screws or wire ties at intersections
- Mark electrode positions on grid

**If using suspended wire:**
- Install 8 eye bolts per layer (24 total)
- Position at marked heights on walls, above electrode positions
- Thread wire through eye bolts, create loops for electrode support
- Don't tension yet (adjust during electrode placement)

### **Phase 2: Install Layer 1 (Bottom Layer, 50cm) - 1-2 hours**

**5. Position Layer 1 support:**

**For mesh or grid:**
- Place temporary supports at 50cm height (buckets, blocks on moraine surface)
- Lay mesh or grid on supports
- Verify it's level (use level tool)
- Verify height (should be exactly 50cm from base)
- Adjust supports as needed

**For suspended wire:**
- Attach electrode wire loops to suspension wires
- Lower electrodes to 50cm height
- Adjust with turnbuckles

**6. Place Layer 1 electrodes (8 total):**

**Order of installation:**
- Start with corner cathodes (easier to position):
  - E1 (corner 1), E2 (corner 2), E3 (corner 3), E4 (corner 4)
- Then center anodes:
  - E13, E14, E15, E16

**Placement procedure per electrode:**
- Unwrap from storage plastic
- Check moisture (should be damp, if dry mist with spray bottle)
- Position on mesh/grid at marked location
- Verify 400mm spacing from neighbors (measure center-to-center)
- Press down gently (electrode should rest securely)
- Route wire up toward wall (not hanging down into drainage)

**7. Verify Layer 1 spacing and alignment:**
- Measure actual distances between electrodes
- Should match design: 400mm ± 20mm
- Check that cathodes are at periphery (closer to walls)
- Check that anodes are at center
- Adjust positions if needed (slide on mesh/grid)

**8. Secure Layer 1 wires:**
- Gather all 8 wires from Layer 1 electrodes
- Route along one wall (choose wall closest to future electrical box)
- Secure with cable ties every 20-30cm
- Label each wire with electrode number (waterproof tape + marker)
- Coil excess wire, secure with tie
- Keep wires above Layer 1 support (don't drape into drainage)

**9. Temporary cover Layer 1 (if not proceeding immediately to Layer 2):**
- Cover electrodes with lightweight tarp or plastic sheet
- Prevents debris from falling onto loaded biochar
- If proceeding to Layer 2 same day: Skip this step

### **Phase 3: Install Layer 2 (Middle Layer, 90cm) - 1-2 hours**

**10. Add interim compost/bulking layer (between Layer 1 and Layer 2):**

Before installing Layer 2, partially fill space above Layer 1:
- Add 15-20cm of compost or bulking material over Layer 1
- Spreads evenly around electrodes
- Creates "bed" for Layer 2 support
- **Don't fully fill yet** - just enough to stabilize Layer 2 support

**Purpose:** 
- Stabilizes Layer 2 mesh/grid (prevents sagging into Layer 1)
- Begins creating stratified compost zones
- Full filling happens in Step 20

**11. Position Layer 2 support at 90cm:**
- Place temporary supports at 90cm height (rest on interim compost)
- Lay second mesh/grid on supports
- Verify level and height
- This layer will be partially embedded in compost later

**12. Place Layer 2 electrodes (8 total):**
- Install in same sequence: cathodes first (E5-E8), then anodes (E17-E20)
- Use offset pattern (rotated 45° from Layer 1)
- Verify 400mm spacing
- Route wires upward along wall
- Secure and label wires

**13. Verify Layer 2 alignment:**
- Check that Layer 2 electrodes are NOT directly above Layer 1
- Offset should be ~200mm (half the spacing distance)
- This prevents direct vertical current paths (want diagonal/distributed flow)

**14. Add second interim compost layer:**
- Add 15-20cm compost above Layer 2 (same as step 10)
- Prepares for Layer 3 installation
- Total compost depth now: ~35-40cm (partial fill)

### **Phase 4: Install Layer 3 (Top Layer, 120cm) - 1-2 hours**

**15. Position Layer 3 support at 120cm:**
- Install support structure 5cm below system rim (120cm from base)
- This is the highest layer - cathodes get maximum O₂ access
- Verify level carefully (visible layer, most critical for appearance)

**16. Place Layer 3 electrodes (8 total):**
- Install cathodes E9-E12 (periphery positions)
- Install anodes E21-E24 (center positions)
- Pattern matches Layer 1 (aligned vertically)
- Verify spacing and positioning

**17. Route all Layer 3 wires:**
- These wires have shortest distance to system top
- Route along wall to electrical connection point
- Secure and label
- Organize with Layer 1 and Layer 2 wires (will have 24 wires total at collection point)

**18. Final wire organization:**
- All 24 electrode wires should now be at one wall location
- Organize in groups:
  - Layer 1 (8 wires)
  - Layer 2 (8 wires)
  - Layer 3 (8 wires)
- Bundle each layer group separately (cable ties)
- Label bundles: "L1", "L2", "L3"
- Coil excess wire neatly
- Secure to wall (prevents falling into compost during filling)

### **Phase 5: Final Verification (30-45 minutes)**

**19. Visual inspection checklist:**

Walk around system, view from all sides and above:
- ✅ **All 24 electrodes installed** (none missing)
- ✅ **Layer heights correct** (50cm, 90cm, 120cm)
- ✅ **Horizontal spacing ~400mm** between electrodes
- ✅ **Cathodes at periphery, anodes at center** in each layer
- ✅ **Layer 2 offset** from Layers 1 and 3
- ✅ **All wires secured** and labeled
- ✅ **No wires pinched or stressed**
- ✅ **Support structures stable** (no sagging, shifting)

**20. Electrical continuity test:**

Test all 24 electrodes before filling system (easier to fix issues now):

**Setup:** Multimeter in resistance (Ω) mode

**For each electrode:**
- Touch Probe 1 to electrode wire (at collection point)
- Touch Probe 2 to biochar surface in electrode
- **Expected:** 50-200Ω (confirms wire-to-biochar connection)
- **If >500Ω or infinite:** Wire connection broken
  - Trace wire to electrode
  - Check for disconnection at hub
  - May need to disassemble electrode and repair (rare but possible)

**Record results:**
- Create table: Electrode number | Resistance | Status
- All should PASS (<300Ω)
- Any failures: Address before proceeding to Step 20

**21. Photo documentation:**
- Take photos from all four sides (shows electrode positions)
- Take overhead photo (shows top layer layout)
- Take close-up of wire organization
- These photos are invaluable for:
  - Future repairs (know where electrodes are located)
  - Troubleshooting (reference original configuration)
  - Sharing with Seigr community (demonstrate your build)

**22. Measure and record positions:**
- For future reference, measure and record actual electrode positions
- Create diagram with exact coordinates from walls
- Note any deviations from design (these happen, it's OK)
- Store diagram with system documentation

## Expected Results

**Installed electrode array:**
- **Total electrodes:** 24 (12 cathodes, 12 anodes)
- **Layer 1 (50cm):** 8 electrodes installed
- **Layer 2 (90cm):** 8 electrodes installed
- **Layer 3 (120cm):** 8 electrodes installed
- **Spacing accuracy:** ±20mm from 400mm target
- **Layer height accuracy:** ±10mm from design heights
- **Wire continuity:** 100% (all 24 electrodes <300Ω)

**Quality indicators:**
✅ **Perfect electrode count** (24 installed, labeled, tested)
✅ **Layer heights correct** (50, 90, 120cm from base)
✅ **Horizontal spacing consistent** (~400mm centers)
✅ **Cathode/anode positioning** follows design (periphery vs center)
✅ **Layer offset** implemented (Layer 2 rotated vs Layers 1/3)
✅ **Wire management** organized, secured, labeled
✅ **Support structures stable** (level, no sagging)
✅ **Electrical continuity** verified for all electrodes

## Troubleshooting

**"Mesh sags under electrode weight"**
- Add more temporary supports (every 40-50cm)
- Or use stiffer mesh (14-gauge vs 16-gauge wire)
- Or switch to wooden slat grid (more rigid)

**"Can't maintain 400mm spacing (walls too close)"**
- Measure actual internal dimensions
- Adjust spacing to 350-380mm (still functional)
- May need to reposition 1-2 electrodes per layer

**"Electrode tips or shifts after placement"**
- Support surface not level (adjust supports)
- Electrode bottom not flat (biochar settled unevenly)
- Mesh/grid flexing (add more supports)
- Solution: Wedge with small wood blocks for stability

**"Wire breaks or pulls out of electrode"**
- Connection at hub failed (from Step 17)
- Need to remove electrode, re-solder wire, reinstall
- This is why we test before filling (much easier to fix now)

**"Can't route all 24 wires along one wall (too crowded)"**
- Option 1: Use two walls (split into 12 wires each side)
- Option 2: Install wire channel or conduit (PVC pipe along wall)
- Option 3: Accept some crossing/bundling (just keep organized)

**"Layer 2 offset pattern creates odd spacing"**
- Offset is approximate, not exact (anywhere from 30-50° rotation OK)
- Goal is to avoid direct vertical stacking
- Even a slight offset (20-30cm) achieves the goal

**"One electrode shows infinite resistance (no continuity)"**
- Wire completely disconnected from electrode
- Locate electrode, check wire connection at hub
- May need to remove electrode, repair, and reinstall
- If electrode can't be repaired: Replace with spare (if available)
- If no spare: System still functional with 23 electrodes (5-10W loss)

**"System rim is too low, can't fit Layer 3 at 120cm"**
- Walls may have settled or were built shorter than planned
- Options:
  - Lower all layers by 5-10cm (maintains relative spacing)
  - Install Layer 3 at highest possible position
  - Extend walls upward (add another board course)

**"Interim compost layer collapses support structures"**
- Compost too heavy or wet
- Solution: Use drier bulking material (wood chips, straw)
- Or add more supports under mesh/grid
- Or use stiffer support structure (thicker wood slats)

## Time and Cost Summary

**Installation time:**
- Preparation and marking: 45-60 min
- Layer 1 installation: 1-2 hours
- Layer 2 installation: 1-2 hours  
- Layer 3 installation: 1-2 hours
- Testing and documentation: 30-45 min

- Wire management: €10-20 (cable ties, labels)
- **Total:** €35-80

**Labor distribution:**
- Can be done solo (easier with helper for mesh positioning)
- Good task for 2-person team (one positions, one secures)

## Connection to Next Steps

**Step 19 outputs (installed electrode array) enable:**

**→ Step 20 (Fill System with Compost):**
- Spaces between and around electrodes filled with organic matter
- Creates the "fuel" and environment for microbial colonization
- Covers interim compost layers (brings system to full 1.25m height)

**→ Step 24 (Heavy Metal Filtration):**
- Drainage from all 3 layers flows through bottom filtration
- System architecture supports vertical leachate movement

**→ Step 25 (Electrical Wiring):**
- All 24 electrode wires connected in series-parallel configuration
- Spatial arrangement (3 layers) enables voltage boosting strategy

The electrode array is the **electrical skeleton** of the system - the framework that captures microbial electrons and organizes them into useful power. Everything from this point forward builds around this structure.
