# Step 15: Coat Electrodes with Graphite

## Objective

Apply conductive graphite coating to electrode structures to create low-resistance electrical contact between biochar particles and collection wires for all 24 electrodes in the high-output system.

**Scale for high-output system:** This step coats 96 electrode quarters (24 electrodes × 4 quarters each). Work in batches of 12-16 quarters (3-4 electrodes) to maintain quality control and prevent coating degradation.

## Why This Matters

**Graphite coating is the electrical interface:**
- **Electron collection** - Provides conductive pathway from biochar to wires
- **Contact resistance reduction** - Graphite layer drops resistance by 80-90%
- **Corrosion protection** - Shields metal components from moisture/acids
- **Biochar adhesion** - Sticky graphite paste holds biochar particles in place
- **Uniform current distribution** - Even coating prevents "hot spots" and dead zones

**Without graphite coating:**
- High contact resistance (80-90% power loss at connections)
- Electrons can't bridge gaps between biochar particles and metal
- Wire corrosion in acidic compost environment
- Biochar falls out of electrode quarters (structural failure)
- Electrical output: <10% of potential

**For 24-electrode high-output system:**
- Each poorly coated electrode = 5-10W power loss
- 5 bad electrodes × 8W loss = 40W total system loss (20% of 200W target!)
- Consistent coating quality across all 96 quarters is CRITICAL

## Understanding Graphite Properties

**Why graphite works:**
- **Electrical conductivity:** 10⁴-10⁵ S/m (nearly as good as metals)
- **Chemical stability:** Resists acids, moisture, microbial attack
- **Flexible structure:** Layers slide (accommodates expansion/contraction)
- **Carbon-carbon bonding:** Adheres well to biochar (also carbon)
- **Low cost:** Available as powder, paint, or paste

**Forms of graphite for MFC:**
1. **Graphite powder** - Mix with binder (best for custom paste)
2. **Graphite paint** - Pre-mixed, brushable (easiest application)
3. **Colloidal graphite** - Suspended in liquid (spray or dip coating)

**Seigr Hub uses:** Graphite powder + linseed oil binder (natural, available, effective)

## Materials Needed

### **For 24 electrodes (96 quarters) - Full System:**

**Graphite materials:**
- **Graphite powder:** 800-1200g (high purity, <50 µm particle size)
  - Coverage: ~10g per quarter × 96 quarters = 960g
  - Add 20% buffer for waste, thick coating = 1150g total
  - Source: Art supply stores, industrial suppliers, online
  - Cost: €30-60 for 1kg

**Binder options (choose one):**
- **Linseed oil:** 400-600ml (natural, waterproof, flexible)
  - Mix ratio: 2 parts graphite : 1 part linseed oil by weight
  - Drying time: 24-48 hours
  - Cost: €10-15 per liter
  
- **PVA glue (diluted):** 300-500ml glue + 100ml water
  - Mix ratio: 3 parts graphite : 1 part diluted PVA
  - Drying time: 12-24 hours
  - Cost: €5-10
  
- **Epoxy resin:** 200-300ml (strongest, but rigid)
  - Use only for structural joints, NOT biochar contact
  - Too rigid for main coating

**Seigr Hub recommendation:** Linseed oil (natural, breathable, proven in MFC applications)

**Application tools (per batch of 12-16 quarters):**
- **Mixing bowl:** 1-2L capacity, non-reactive (glass, stainless steel)
- **Measuring tools:** Scale (1g precision), measuring cups
- **Stirring stick:** Wooden or metal, disposable preferred
- **Brushes:** 3-5 cm wide, stiff bristles (chip brushes work well)
  - Need 4-6 brushes total (replace when saturated)
- **Gloves:** Nitrile or latex (graphite stains skin)
- **Drop cloth:** Protect work surface from drips
- **Containers:** Small jars for mixed paste (airtight lids)

**Wire preparation (for electrode assembly in Step 17):**
- **Copper wire:** 18-20 AWG, stranded (flexible)
  - Length: 30cm per electrode × 24 = 7.2m total
  - Pre-cut and strip 2cm at each end
- **Solder and flux:** For wire-to-wire connections (Step 25)

## Graphite Paste Formulation

### **Recipe: High-Conductivity Linseed-Graphite Paste**

**Batch size (covers 12-16 quarters = 3-4 electrodes):**

**Ingredients:**
- Graphite powder: 150g
- Linseed oil (raw or boiled): 75ml (≈ 70g)
- Optional: Turpentine 5-10ml (thins paste for easier brushing)

**Ratio by weight:** 2:1 graphite:linseed oil

**Properties:**
- **Viscosity:** Thick paste (like peanut butter)
- **Drying time:** 24-48 hours (touch-dry in 12 hours)
- **Conductivity:** 2000-5000 S/m (excellent for MFC)
- **Flexibility:** Remains slightly flexible when cured
- **Shelf life:** 2-3 weeks in sealed container

### **Mixing Procedure:**

**1. Prepare workspace:**
- Clean, dry surface
- Good ventilation (linseed oil fumes)
- All materials within reach
- Weigh out ingredients before starting

**2. Combine dry graphite:**
- Pour 150g graphite powder into mixing bowl
- Break up any clumps with stirring stick
- Ensure uniform powder (no lumps)

**3. Add binder gradually:**
- Pour 50ml linseed oil into center of graphite
- Stir vigorously with stick (scrape bowl sides)
- Paste will form clumps initially - keep stirring
- Add remaining 25ml oil in 5ml increments
- Stir 2-3 minutes after each addition

**4. Achieve target consistency:**
- **Too thick (like clay):** Add 5-10ml more oil
- **Too thin (like paint):** Add 10-20g more graphite
- **Target (like thick frosting):** Holds shape but spreads easily

**5. Test consistency:**
- Dip brush in paste
- Should coat brush thickly
- Should spread smoothly on test surface
- Should NOT drip or run
- Should leave visible texture when brushed

**6. Adjust if needed:**
- For easier brushing: Add 5ml turpentine (thins without reducing conductivity)
- For thicker coating: Add more graphite
- Record final amounts for next batch

**Paste quality indicators:**
✅ Uniform dark gray-black color
✅ Smooth texture (no dry lumps)
✅ Spreads easily but doesn't run
✅ Slight sheen from oil
✅ No separation (oil pooling on surface)

## Application Process

### **Batch Workflow (Repeat 6-8 Times for All 96 Quarters):**

**Batch 1:** Quarters 1-16 (electrodes 1-4)
**Batch 2:** Quarters 17-32 (electrodes 5-8)
**... continue ...**
**Batch 6:** Quarters 81-96 (electrodes 21-24)

### **Phase 1: Prepare Quarters (15-20 minutes per batch)**

**1. Clean electrode surfaces:**
- Wipe quarters with dry cloth (remove dust, debris)
- Check for loose parts (tighten screws, repair cracks)
- If 3D printed: Lightly sand with 220-grit sandpaper (improves adhesion)
- If wood/plywood: No sanding needed (rough texture is good)

**2. Position for coating:**
- Lay quarters on drop cloth, inner surface facing up
- Space 10-15cm apart (prevents accidental contact)
- Orient so all biochar-contact surfaces are accessible
- Label each quarter (pencil mark: "E1Q1" = Electrode 1 Quarter 1)

**3. Attach wire leads (optional - can do in Step 17 instead):**
- Cut 30cm copper wire for each electrode (4 quarters share 1 wire)
- Strip 2cm insulation from one end
- Position wire so stripped end sits in electrode center
- Will be embedded in graphite paste

### **Phase 2: Apply Graphite Coating (30-45 minutes per batch)**

**4. First coat - Thin priming layer:**
- Dip brush in paste, scrape excess on bowl edge
- Apply thin, even layer to all biochar-contact surfaces
- Brush in one direction (creates texture for next layer)
- Cover 100% of surface (no bare spots)
- **Thickness target:** 0.5-1mm (you can still see surface texture through paste)

**Key surfaces to coat:**
- Inner walls of electrode quarter
- Bottom surface (biochar sits here)
- Hub connection area (electrical continuity)
- Wire contact point (if wire attached)

**DO NOT coat:**
- Outer walls (no electrical function)
- Assembly tabs/slots (need friction fit)
- Vent holes (must remain open for gas/water flow)

**5. Embed wire (if attaching now):**
- While first coat is still wet:
- Press stripped wire end into paste at electrode center
- Push down so wire is fully embedded (paste covers it)
- Smooth paste around wire (creates solid electrical contact)
- Ensure wire doesn't touch outer wall (prevent short circuit)

**6. Let first coat set (2-4 hours):**
- Move coated quarters to drying area
- Keep flat and level (prevents sagging)
- Touch-dry in 2-4 hours (surface no longer tacky)
- Don't stack or disturb

**7. Second coat - Thick conductive layer:**
- Check first coat is touch-dry (not fully cured, just not sticky)
- Apply second coat same as first, but thicker
- Brush perpendicular to first coat direction (crosshatch pattern)
- **Thickness target:** 1-2mm total (opaque, textured surface)
- Build up at wire connection (extra conductive mass)

**8. Create biochar key texture:**
- While second coat is still wet:
- Use brush tip to create rough texture (like stippling)
- Small peaks and valleys help biochar particles lock in
- Don't overwork (creates thin spots)

**9. Final drying (24-48 hours):**
- Move to dust-free drying area
- Stack carefully if needed (put spacers between quarters)
- Check at 24 hours: Should be hard to touch
- Fully cured: 48-72 hours (linseed oil polymerizes slowly)

### **Phase 3: Quality Control (10-15 minutes per batch)**

**10. Visual inspection (after 24 hours):**

Check each quarter for:
- ✅ **Complete coverage:** No bare spots, uniform coating
- ✅ **Proper thickness:** 1-2mm, slightly rough texture
- ✅ **No defects:** No cracks, bubbles, or separation
- ✅ **Wire embedded:** Wire fully covered at connection point
- ✅ **Clean edges:** No drips on assembly features

**Common defects and fixes:**
- **Bare spots:** Dab paste on spot, smooth, let dry 24h
- **Too thin:** Apply touch-up coat to entire surface
- **Bubbles/cracks:** Sand lightly, apply thin patch coat
- **Drips on edges:** Scrape off with knife before fully cured

**11. Electrical continuity test:**

**Equipment needed:**
- Multimeter set to resistance (Ω) mode
- Two test probes

**Test procedure:**
- Touch one probe to wire (if embedded)
- Touch other probe to graphite coating surface
- **Expected result:** <10Ω resistance (good contact)
- **If >50Ω:** Poor wire contact, remove and re-embed wire
- **If infinite resistance:** No contact, circuit open, redo coating

**Alternative (if no wire yet):**
- Touch probes to two points on graphite coating 5cm apart
- **Expected result:** <20Ω (conductive path exists)

**12. Document batch:**
- Record batch number, date, quarters included
- Note any repairs or special treatments
- Mark "PASS" or "REWORK" on each quarter
- Store passed quarters in clean, dry container

## Coating Variations for Electrode Types

**Cathodes (12 electrodes - Quarters 1-48):**
- **Coating:** Standard graphite-linseed paste (as above)
- **Special treatment:** Apply Mn nodule enhancement in Step 16
- **Thickness:** 1.5-2mm (slightly thicker for Mn adhesion)

**Anodes (12 electrodes - Quarters 49-96):**
- **Coating:** Same graphite-linseed paste
- **No Mn treatment** (Mn is for cathodes only)
- **Thickness:** 1-1.5mm (thinner is acceptable)

**Both types get identical graphite coating - differentiation happens in Step 16.**

## Storage and Handling

**Coated quarters (before assembly):**
- Stack in boxes with separators (cardboard, foam)
- Keep dry (moisture can degrade linseed oil cure)
- Store <30°C (high heat can soften coating)
- Use within 6 months (coating remains workable)

**Unused graphite paste:**
- Transfer to airtight jar immediately after use
- Press plastic wrap onto surface (prevents skin formation)
- Seal tightly
- Store in cool, dark place
- Shelf life: 2-3 weeks
- Stir vigorously before reuse (may need to add 5-10ml oil)

**If paste hardens in storage:**
- Add 10-20ml linseed oil
- Stir thoroughly
- May need 5-10ml turpentine to restore consistency
- Test on scrap before using on electrodes

## Safety and Cleanup

**Health precautions:**
- **Graphite dust:** Wear dust mask when handling dry powder
- **Linseed oil fumes:** Work in ventilated area (VOCs during curing)
- **Skin contact:** Wear gloves (graphite stains, oil dries skin)
- **Eye protection:** Safety glasses when mixing (powder can puff)

**Environmental:**
- Graphite is carbon (non-toxic, biodegradable)
- Linseed oil is natural plant product (low environmental impact)
- Dispose of cleanup rags properly (can self-ignite if bunched when oil-soaked!)

**Cleanup procedure:**
- **Brushes:** Wash in mineral spirits or turpentine, then soap and water
- **Bowls/tools:** Wipe with cloth, wash with dish soap
- **Spills:** Absorb with sawdust/sand, sweep up, discard
- **Oil-soaked rags:** Lay flat to dry OR soak in water-filled metal container (fire prevention!)

**Fire hazard - CRITICAL:**
Linseed oil rags can spontaneously combust during oxidation (curing process generates heat).
- NEVER bunch up oil-soaked rags
- NEVER put in closed trash can
- Either: Lay flat outside to fully dry (2-3 days)
- Or: Submerge in water-filled metal bucket, then dispose when fully cured

## Expected Results

**Per batch (16 quarters = 4 electrodes):**
- **Time:** 1 hour mixing + 45 min coating + 2 hours second coat = ~4 hours active work
- **Materials:** 150g graphite + 75ml linseed oil
- **Drying:** 24-48 hours between batches
- **Pass rate:** 90-95% (5-10% need touch-ups)

**Complete system (96 quarters = 24 electrodes):**
- **Total time:** 6 batches × 4 hours = 24 hours active work spread over 2-3 weeks (drying time)
- **Total materials:** 900-1100g graphite, 450-550ml linseed oil
- **Cost:** €35-65 for complete coating system

**Quality indicators:**
✅ **Uniform dark gray-black coating** across all quarters
✅ **1-2mm thickness** measured with calipers or visual estimate
✅ **Textured surface** (not smooth and glossy)
✅ **<10Ω resistance** from wire to coating surface
✅ **Hard, dry surface** after 48 hours cure
✅ **No defects** (cracks, bubbles, bare spots)

## Troubleshooting

**"Paste is too runny, drips off brush"**
- Add graphite powder 10g at a time, stir thoroughly
- Or add 20-30g powdered biochar (increases viscosity + conductivity)
- Check linseed oil wasn't measured incorrectly

**"Paste is too thick, won't spread"**
- Add linseed oil 5ml at a time
- Or add 5-10ml turpentine (easier than adding more oil)
- Warm bowl in hot water bath (makes oil more fluid - careful!)

**"Coating cracks during drying"**
- Applied too thick in one coat (max 1mm per layer)
- Dried too fast (high heat, direct sun, forced air)
- Too much graphite, not enough binder
- Fix: Sand lightly, apply thin repair coat

**"Coating stays sticky after 48 hours"**
- Humidity too high (linseed oil cures by oxidation, moisture slows it)
- Applied too thick (inner layers can't access oxygen)
- Old linseed oil (check expiration, oil can go rancid)
- Fix: Move to warm, dry area, wait another 2-3 days

**"Can't get uniform thickness"**
- Practice on scrap first (cardboard, wood)
- Use stiffer brush (easier to control paste thickness)
- Apply thinner coats, build up gradually
- Mark target thickness on test piece (visual reference)

**"Graphite powder won't mix into oil, stays lumpy"**
- Add oil too fast (overwhelmed graphite absorption)
- Graphite has moisture (should be bone dry)
- Stir more vigorously, longer (can take 5 minutes)
- Break lumps against bowl side with stirring stick

**"Coating peels off electrode surface"**
- Surface was contaminated (oil, moisture, dust)
- No primer coat (thick coat applied directly)
- Wrong surface (some plastics don't bond - sand first)
- Fix: Remove coating, clean surface, sand, recoat

**"Wire falls out of coating"**
- Paste was too thin where wire embedded
- Wire moved before paste set
- Not enough paste around wire
- Fix: Re-embed wire with extra paste, let fully cure before handling

## Connection to Next Steps

**Step 15 outputs (graphite-coated quarters) feed into:**

**→ Step 16 (Manganese Enhancement):**
- Cathode quarters receive Mn nodule coating
- Applied over graphite layer
- Improves oxygen reduction reaction

**→ Step 17 (Electrode Assembly):**
- 4 coated quarters + 1 hub = complete electrode
- Graphite coating is foundation for biochar adhesion
- Wires connect quarters electrically

**The graphite layer is permanent infrastructure** - every electron generated in biochar must pass through this coating to reach collection wires. Quality here determines electrical efficiency of entire system.
