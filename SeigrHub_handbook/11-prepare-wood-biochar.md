# Step 11: Prepare Wood Biochar

## Objective

Produce high-quality wood biochar through controlled pyrolysis to create the primary electrode material and conductive matrix for your microbial fuel cell system.

## Why This Matters

**Biochar is the foundation of MFC performance:**

- **High surface area** - 150-400 m²/g (massive habitat for microbes)
- **Electrical conductivity** - Allows electron transfer from bacteria to electrode
- **Chemical stability** - Lasts 7-10+ years without degrading
- **Porous structure** - Allows water, nutrients, and gases to circulate
- **pH neutral** - Doesn't acidify or alkalize system over time

**Without biochar, you have compost, not an MFC:**

- Soil or organic matter alone: ~0.01-1 m²/g surface area (100-1000× less)
- Poor conductivity: Electrons can't flow to collection points
- Result: Decomposition happens, but electricity generation is minimal

**Wood biochar vs Fe-humus biochar (Step 12):**

- **Wood biochar (this step):** Clean carbon, high surface area, general purpose
- **Fe-humus biochar (Step 12):** Enhanced with iron, higher conductivity, Norwegian optimization
- **Both are needed:** 70% wood + 30% Fe-humus = optimal blend for Seigr Hub

**Pyrolysis quality affects performance:**

- Too low temperature (<350°C): Incomplete carbonization, still smolders, tarry
- Optimal temperature (450-550°C): Maximum surface area, stable carbon structure
- Too high temperature (>700°C): Surface area decreases (pores collapse), harder/more brittle

## Understanding Biochar Production (Pyrolysis)

**What is pyrolysis?**

- Thermal decomposition of organic material in absence (or limited presence) of oxygen
- Heat drives off volatile compounds (water, tars, gases)
- Leaves behind fixed carbon (biochar)

**Chemical process:**

- **150-200°C:** Water evaporation (steam release)
- **200-300°C:** Hemicellulose breaks down (smoke begins)
- **300-400°C:** Cellulose decomposes (heavy smoke, tars)
- **400-500°C:** Lignin carbonizes (structure stabilizes, smoke reduces)
- **500-600°C:** Carbon matrix fully forms (light smoke, mostly CO₂ and H₂)

**Mass loss during pyrolysis:**

- Starting wood: 100kg (dry weight)
- Water driven off: ~10kg (if pre-dried)
- Volatiles driven off: ~60-70kg (gases, tars)
- **Biochar yield: 20-30kg** (20-30% of dry weight)

**Energy balance:**

- Pyrolysis is endothermic initially (requires heat input)
- Becomes exothermic once started (volatile combustion provides heat)
- Well-designed system is self-sustaining after ignition

## Biochar Feedstock Selection

**Best woods for MFC biochar:**

**Hardwoods (preferred):**

- **Oak, birch, alder** - Dense, high fixed carbon content
- **Yield:** 25-30% biochar by weight
- **Surface area:** 200-350 m²/g
- **Availability at Seigr Hub:** Birch very common, alder near streams

**Softwoods (acceptable):**

- **Pine, spruce** - Abundant, easier to process
- **Yield:** 20-25% biochar by weight
- **Surface area:** 150-250 m²/g (slightly lower due to resin content)
- **Availability at Seigr Hub:** Extremely abundant (Norway spruce, Scots pine)

**Avoid:**

- Treated wood (pressure-treated, painted) - Toxic chemicals (arsenic, lead)
- Plywood, particle board - Glues contain formaldehyde, other toxins
- Fresh green wood - Excess moisture (steam explosions, poor yield)

**Seigr Hub recommendation:**

- **Use deadfall and storm-damaged trees** (reclaimed, no cutting live trees)
- **Mix hardwood + softwood** (e.g., 50% birch + 50% pine)
- **Blend yields balanced properties** (surface area + yield + availability)

**Preparation of feedstock:**

- **Dry to <20% moisture:** Air-dry for 6-12 months, or kiln-dry for 1-2 weeks
- **Cut to uniform size:** 5-10cm diameter branches, 30-50cm lengths
- **Split large pieces:** Increases surface area exposed to heat (faster, more uniform pyrolysis)
- **Remove bark (optional):** Bark contains more ash (lowers carbon purity), but also trace minerals (can be beneficial)

## Pyrolysis Methods

**Three practical options for Seigr Hub:**

### **Method 1: Kon-Tiki Cone Kiln (Recommended)**

**Description:**

- Inverted cone-shaped pit or metal vessel
- Batch process (load wood, burn, extinguish, harvest biochar)
- Accessible, low-tech, traditional Scandinavian approach

**Advantages:**

- Simple construction (dig pit or use metal cone)
- Large batches (50-200L biochar per burn)
- Good temperature control (visible flame color indicates temp)
- Community/educational value (gather neighbors, share knowledge)

**Disadvantages:**

- Smoke production (need open area, calm wind day)
- Requires attention (3-5 hours active monitoring)
- Less efficient (some biochar burns to ash if over-fired)

**Materials needed:**

- Cone pit: 1-2m diameter top, 0.5-1m depth, sloped sides (45-60°)
- Or metal cone: Fabricated from sheet metal, 1m diameter × 0.6m deep
- Extinguishing method: 50-100L water, or soil to smother

### **Method 2: Retort Barrel (Efficient, Controlled)**

**Description:**

- Double-barrel system: Inner barrel (feedstock) sealed inside outer barrel (fire chamber)
- Inner barrel gases vent and combust in outer barrel (self-sustaining heat)
- More complex, but higher quality and efficiency

**Advantages:**

- Higher yield (25-30% vs 20-25% for cone kiln)
- Cleaner burn (less smoke, gases are consumed)
- Better biochar quality (more uniform temperature)
- Can capture tars (useful for wood preservative, Step 09 coating)

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires two barrels (200L drums - can be salvaged)
- More setup time (cutting, welding or bolting)
- Heavier, less portable

**Materials needed:**

- Inner barrel: 200L steel drum with sealable lid, vent pipe welded in lid
- Outer barrel: 200L drum with top cut off (or larger, 300L)
- Fire bricks or gravel: Insulation between barrels
- Chimney pipe: 10cm diameter, 1-2m tall (draft)

### **Method 3: Trench Kiln (Zero-Cost, Basic)**

**Description:**

- Simple trench dug in ground, lined with stones
- Covered with metal sheet or earth after ignition
- Primitive but functional

**Advantages:**

- Zero material cost
- Can be any size
- Easy to abandon after use (fill in trench)

**Disadvantages:**

- Poor temperature control (uneven heating)
- Lower yield (15-20%, more ash contamination)
- More smoke (incomplete combustion)
- Labor-intensive (digging, covering, excavating char)

**Materials needed:**

- Shovel (dig trench)
- Stones (line trench, retain heat)
- Metal sheet or sod (covering to limit oxygen)

**Seigr Hub recommendation:**

- **Start with Method 1 (Kon-Tiki)** - Good balance of simplicity, yield, quality
- **Upgrade to Method 2 (Retort)** if doing frequent batches or want maximum efficiency

## Kon-Tiki Cone Kiln Process (Detailed)

**We'll detail this method as it's recommended for first build:**

### **Construction:**

**1. Dig cone-shaped pit:**

- Top diameter: 1.5-2.0m
- Bottom diameter: 0.5-0.8m
- Depth: 0.6-1.0m
- Sloped sides: 45-60° angle (steep enough for draft, gentle enough for stability)

**2. Line with stones (optional but helpful):**

- Protects soil from excessive heating
- Retains heat better (thermal mass)
- Reusable for future burns

**3. Create air intake:**

- Small trench (5cm deep, 10cm wide) from pit edge to center bottom
- Allows oxygen to feed base of fire
- Controls combustion rate

### **Operation:**

**4. Load initial fuel (starter wood):**

- Small, dry kindling at bottom center
- Larger sticks in criss-cross pattern above
- Build up to 1/3 pit depth
- Light fire with match or torch

**5. Monitor ignition:**

- Fire should establish in 5-10 minutes
- Flame color: Yellow-orange (indicates 400-600°C range)
- Too red: Too cool, add more kindling
- White-blue: Too hot, reduce air flow (partially cover air intake)

**6. Add feedstock wood incrementally:**

- As initial fuel burns down and glows red, add prepared wood pieces
- Feed from top, around perimeter (don't smother center fire)
- Add 5-10kg every 10-15 minutes
- Wood pieces should char (turn black) before next addition

**7. Maintain temperature:**

- **Visual indicators:**
  - Steady flames: Good (500-550°C)
  - Smoky, no flames: Too cool, add smaller pieces or increase air
  - Roaring flames, white-hot center: Too hot, reduce feeding rate
- **Smoke color:**
  - White/gray: Water vapor + light volatiles (expected)
  - Thick black: Heavy tars, temp too low (increase heat)
  - Minimal smoke: Pyrolysis complete (ready for next load or extinguish)

**8. Fill to capacity:**

- Continue adding wood until pit is 80-90% full with glowing char
- Total time: 3-5 hours for full pit
- Total wood input: 100-200kg (dry weight)
- Expected output: 20-60kg biochar

**9. Extinguish when complete:**

- **Water method:** Pour water slowly over glowing char (creates steam, avoid burns)
  - Stir char as you water (ensures even extinguishing)
  - Char should be cool enough to touch within 30-60 minutes
- **Soil method:** Shovel soil over char to smother
  - Compacts char less (preserves pore structure)
  - Takes longer to cool (2-4 hours)

**10. Harvest biochar:**

- Once cool, shovel out char
- Screen through 5-10mm mesh (removes un-charred wood, large chunks)
- Store in bins or bags (dry location)

### **Safety Considerations:**

**Fire safety:**

- Clear 5-10m radius around kiln (remove dry grass, leaves)
- Have water source nearby (hose or buckets)
- Fire extinguisher on hand
- Never leave fire unattended
- Check local fire regulations (may need permit or restricted to certain seasons)

**Personal safety:**

- Wear long sleeves, pants (cotton, not synthetic - won't melt)
- Leather gloves (heat resistant)
- Eye protection (flying sparks)
- Stay upwind of smoke (respiratory protection if sensitive)

**Environmental:**

- Burn on calm days (wind spreads embers)
- Morning or evening (cooler, less convective lifting of smoke)
- Avoid nesting season (March-June) - smoke disturbs wildlife

## Retort Barrel Process (Alternative)

**For those wanting higher efficiency:**

### **Construction:**

**1. Prepare inner barrel:**

- Clean 200L steel drum
- Drill 10-15 small holes (5mm) near top rim (gas vents)
- Or weld 2-3cm pipe to center of lid (chimney vent)
- Load with prepared wood (split, dry)
- Seal lid (but allow vent to remain open)

**2. Prepare outer barrel:**

- Cut top off 200L drum (or use larger drum that inner fits into)
- Place fire bricks or gravel in bottom (insulates, elevates inner barrel)
- Set inner barrel inside (on bricks, suspended above outer barrel bottom)

**3. Build fire in outer barrel:**

- Arrange kindling around outer circumference of inner barrel
- Light fire
- Feed fire with small wood pieces around inner barrel
- Vent gases from inner barrel will ignite and burn (self-sustaining)

### **Operation:**

**4. Monitor temperature:**

- Outer barrel fire should be vigorous but not roaring
- Inner barrel will heat to 450-550°C (verify with infrared thermometer if available)
- Gases venting from inner barrel should ignite (blue-yellow flame)
- Thick smoke = too cool, increase outer fire

**5. Maintain process:**

- 2-4 hours total time (depends on barrel size and wood density)
- When gas venting from inner barrel stops (minimal smoke), pyrolysis is complete
- Outer fire will die down (no more fuel from inner barrel gases)

**6. Cool and harvest:**

- Let barrels cool 6-12 hours (or overnight)
- Remove inner barrel (use gloves, may still be warm)
- Open lid, harvest biochar
- Yield: 25-30% of input wood weight

**Advantages over cone kiln:**

- Less smoke (gases combust in outer barrel)
- Higher biochar yield (better oxygen exclusion)
- Can capture tars (place collection pan under vent pipe - biochar tar drips out)

## Biochar Quality Testing

**After production, verify quality:**

### **Visual Inspection:**

- **Color:** Deep black (not gray or brown - indicates incomplete pyrolysis)
- **Structure:** Retains wood grain (pore structure intact)
- **Texture:** Breaks easily, but not to dust (too brittle = over-fired)
- **Sound:** Metallic "clink" when pieces strike each other (indicates good carbon structure)

### **Physical Tests:**

**1. Water absorption test:**

- Place handful of biochar in water
- Should sink within seconds (pores fill with water - good surface area)
- If floats for >1 minute: Poor quality (low porosity or waxy residue)

**2. Ash content:**

- Burn small sample (10-20g) completely in open flame
- Weigh remaining ash
- **Target:** <10% ash by weight (indicates high carbon purity)
- **Acceptable:** 10-20% ash (some mineral content from bark, okay for MFC use)
- **Poor:** >20% ash (over-fired or contaminated feedstock)

**3. Crush resistance:**

- Apply moderate hand pressure to piece
- Should break into chunks, not powder
- Pieces hold together (good structural integrity)

### **Chemical Test (Optional):**

**pH test:**

- Crush 10g biochar
- Mix with 100ml distilled water
- Let sit 30 minutes
- Test pH (should be 6.5-8.5, slightly alkaline is typical)
- If acidic (<6.0): May still contain tars, need higher temp or longer pyrolysis

## Biochar Processing (Post-Production)

**Before using in electrodes:**

**1. Cooling:**

- Spread biochar on non-flammable surface
- Let cool to ambient temperature (12-24 hours)
- May still have internal hot spots (infrared camera can reveal)

**2. Screening:**

- Pass through two screens:
  - Coarse (10-15mm): Removes large chunks (can be re-crushed or used for drainage)
  - Fine (2-5mm): Removes dust (too fine, clogs pores, use for heavy metal filter instead)
- **Keep middle fraction** (2-10mm) for electrode biochar

**3. Washing (critical for MFC use):**

- Place screened biochar in large container
- Cover with water (2:1 water:biochar ratio by volume)
- Stir vigorously
- Let settle 1-2 minutes, pour off black water (contains ash, fine dust)
- Repeat 3-5 times until rinse water is clear or light gray
- **Purpose:** Removes ash (can alkalize system excessively), fine particles (clog pores)

**4. Drying:**

- Spread washed biochar on tarps in sun
- Stir every 6-12 hours (prevents mold)
- 2-5 days drying (depends on weather)
- Biochar should be bone-dry before storage or use (moisture causes clumping)

**5. Storage:**

- Store in breathable bags (burlap, woven plastic)
- Keep dry (moisture-free location)
- Label: "Wood Biochar - Electrode Grade - [Date] - [Wood Species]"
- Shelf life: Indefinite if kept dry

## Quality Checks

After completing this step, you should have:

✅ **Biochar produced:** 15-30L (enough for 1m³ system)  
✅ **Quality verified:** Black color, metallic sound, <10% ash  
✅ **Processed:** Screened, washed, dried  
✅ **Stored:** Dry location, labeled, ready for electrode fabrication  
✅ **Safety maintained:** No injuries, fire controlled, site cleaned  

## Timeline

**Biochar production:** 1-2 days total

- Kiln setup: 2-4 hours (first time; faster for subsequent batches)
- Pyrolysis operation: 3-5 hours (active monitoring)
- Cooling: 12-24 hours (passive)
- Processing: 2-4 hours (screening, washing, spreading to dry)
- Drying: 2-5 days (passive, weather-dependent)

## Troubleshooting

**"Biochar is gray or brown, not black"**

- Incomplete pyrolysis (too low temperature)
- Re-fire: Heat biochar again in kiln until black (can improve quality)
- Or discard to compost, start over with better temperature control

**"Biochar turns to dust when handled"**

- Over-fired (too high temperature or too long)
- Can still be used, but blend with less-brittle biochar
- Or use for heavy metal filter (Step 10) instead of electrode

**"High ash content (>20%)"**

- Feedstock had high mineral content (bark, soil contamination)
- Or incomplete combustion (ash mixed with char)
- Wash more thoroughly (multiple rinses)
- Acceptable for MFC if pH test passes (minerals can be beneficial)

**"Biochar floats in water, won't absorb"**

- Tarry residues blocking pores (too low pyrolysis temperature)
- Try washing with hot water or dilute vinegar (dissolves tars)
- Or re-fire to higher temperature
- If still floats, quality is poor - use for general compost, not electrodes

**"Heavy smoke, bothering neighbors"**

- Pyrolysis temperature too low (thick black smoke = tars)
- Increase combustion air, hotter fire
- Or switch to retort method (cleaner burn)
- Time burns for calm days, early morning

**"Fire keeps going out during pyrolysis"**

- Wood too wet (even if "dry" by touch, may be 20-30% internal moisture)
- Pre-dry wood more (6-12 months air drying)
- Or use smaller pieces (dry faster during burn)

**"Not enough feedstock wood"**

- Scavenge from property cleanup (deadfall, storm damage)
- Ask neighbors (many have waste wood from tree trimming)
- Check sawmills (slab wood, offcuts often free)
- Plan ahead: Collect wood year-round, stockpile for biochar production

## Important Notes

**Biochar production is an art and science:**

- First batch may not be perfect (learning curve)
- Each subsequent batch improves with experience
- Temperature control is key (practice visual cues)

**Quality varies but system is forgiving:**

- Even medium-quality biochar (15-20% ash, some dust) works
- Perfect biochar is ideal, but good biochar is sufficient
- The microbes adapt to what you provide

**This is a traditional skill:**

- Charcoal production dates back millennia (Terra Preta in Amazon, 2000+ years old)
- Scandinavian tradition: Charcoal for smithing, industrial uses
- Seigr philosophy: Revive traditional knowledge with modern understanding

**Batch size planning:**

- 2m³ high-output system needs 40-50L wood biochar (70% of blend for 24 electrodes)
- 1m³ small system needs 15-20L wood biochar (70% of blend for 6 electrodes)
- One Kon-Tiki burn (100kg wood input) yields ~20-30kg biochar (~40-60L)
- **One batch provides enough for 2-3 systems**
- Share with neighbors or save for system expansion

**Safety and respect:**

- Fire is powerful and dangerous (complacency causes accidents)
- Site must be clear, tools ready, attention focused
- Honor the wood (it grew for decades, transform it with care)
- Biochar sequesters carbon (climate positive - turning CO₂ into stable carbon)

---

**Wood biochar complete - foundation of conductivity secured!**

With high-quality, porous, electrically conductive carbon in hand, we have the primary material that will enable microbial electron transfer. This biochar will host trillions of bacteria, provide pathways for electrical current, and persist for 7-10 years without degradation.

Next: **Step 12 - Prepare Iron-Humus Biochar** (which we've already created! But it's now in proper sequence. We'll reference it as complete and move to Step 13).
