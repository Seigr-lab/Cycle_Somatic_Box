# Step 12: Prepare Iron-Humus Biochar

## Objective

Pyrolyze the collected forest humus to create iron-enhanced biochar with 2-3× higher electrical conductivity than standard wood biochar. This locally-sourced material eliminates the need for external iron additives while providing superior MFC performance.

## Why This Matters

The forest humus you collected in Step 05 contains iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) complexed with organic molecules. When heated in low-oxygen conditions (pyrolysis), these metals become embedded in the carbon matrix, creating a naturally conductive biochar.

**The science:**

- **Organic Fe complexes** → Pyrolysis (500°C) → **Metallic Fe nanoparticles** in carbon
- Fe particles create conductive pathways between carbon structures
- Result: Electrical conductivity increases from ~50 µS/cm to 120-300 µS/cm

**Performance impact:**

- MFC current density: +40-60%
- Microbial electron transfer efficiency: +35-50%
- System total power output: +3-5W continuous
- Electrode lifespan: +2-3 years (Fe prevents degradation)

## Understanding Pyrolysis

**Pyrolysis = Heating organic material in absence of oxygen**

### **What Happens at Different Temperatures:**

**200-300°C:**

- Water driven off (steam)
- Volatile organics begin breaking down
- Material browns, then blackens
- NOT yet biochar (still has organics)

**300-400°C:**

- Volatile compounds released (smoke, tar, gases)
- Carbon structure begins forming
- Material shrinks ~30-40%
- Partially carbonized

**400-500°C (Our target):**

- Complete carbonization
- Stable carbon matrix formed
- Fe/Mn metals reduced to elemental/oxide forms
- Optimal for electrode biochar
- Retains some surface functional groups (good for microbes)

**500-600°C:**

- More graphitic carbon structure
- Higher conductivity but less reactive
- Better for pure conductive applications
- Can be more brittle

**>700°C:**

- Very graphitic, crystalline structure
- Maximum conductivity
- Poor microbial colonization
- Used for filtration, not electrodes

**For humus biochar: 450-550°C is ideal**

- Preserves some organic functionality
- Develops good conductivity
- Embeds Fe particles optimally

## Materials & Tools Needed

### **Pyrolysis Container:**

**Option 1: Steel paint can (preferred for small batches)**

- Clean, dry 5-liter metal paint can with tight lid
- Punch/drill one 5mm hole in lid (gas release)
- Cost: ~$10-15 or reclaimed from workshop

**Option 2: Large steel drum (for bigger batches)**

- 20-liter steel drum with sealable lid
- Multiple small holes punched in lid
- More efficient but needs bigger fire

**What NOT to use:**

- Aluminum (melts at low temp)
- Galvanized metal (releases toxic zinc fumes)
- Thin steel (burns through)
- Completely sealed container (explosion risk)

### **Heat Source:**

**Option 1: Campfire (traditional, works well)**

- Build fire pit or use existing
- Hardwood fuel (birch, oak) - burns hot and long
- Need good coals, not just flames

**Option 2: Rocket stove**

- More efficient fuel use
- Better temperature control
- Consistent heat

**Option 3: Propane burner**

- Gas camping stove or turkey fryer burner
- Easier temperature monitoring
- Less traditional but very controllable

### **Temperature Monitoring:**

**Essential:**

- **IR thermometer (gun-style)** - Point at container, read temp
- Range: 0-600°C minimum
- Cost: $20-40

**Alternative:**

- Visual cues (color changes - see below)
- Time-based estimation
- Less precise but workable

### **Safety Equipment:**

**Required:**

- **Welding gloves** or thick leather gloves (heat protection)
- **Fire extinguisher** (metal/wood rated)
- **Long metal tongs** (for moving hot container)
- **Water bucket** (emergency backup)

**Recommended:**

- Safety glasses (sparks, ash)
- Long sleeves, long pants (fire-resistant)
- Clear space (3m radius) around fire

### **Processing Tools:**

- **Metal screens** (5mm and 10mm mesh) - Sifting biochar
- **Hammer** or rock - Breaking large pieces
- **Bucket** - For quenching (stopping pyrolysis)
- **Storage container** - Airtight for finished biochar

## Pre-Pyrolysis Preparation

### **Humus Preparation (From Step 05):**

**Verify dryness:**

1. Take small handful
2. Should crumble to powder easily
3. No moisture visible or felt
4. If still moist → re-dry completely

**Why critical:**

- Moisture → steam during pyrolysis
- Steam → pressure buildup in container
- Could crack container or blow lid off

**Final check:**

- Squeeze tight in fist
- Open hand - should fall apart immediately
- No clumping = ready

### **Container Preparation:**

1. **Clean thoroughly:**
   - No residual paint, oil, or chemicals
   - Wire brush inside if needed
   - Rinse and dry completely

2. **Prepare vent hole:**
   - Drill or punch 5mm hole in lid center
   - Smooth edges (prevent snag hazard)
   - This releases gases but prevents oxygen entry

3. **Fill container:**
   - Add dry humus loosely (don't pack)
   - Fill to 70-80% capacity (leaves expansion room)
   - From 1.5L dry humus → fills ~2-2.5L container space

4. **Seal properly:**
   - Place lid firmly on container
   - Can add wire or clamp for security
   - Vent hole must remain open

## Pyrolysis Process

### **Step 1: Build Fire (20-30 minutes)**

**For campfire method:**

1. **Site selection:**
   - Fire-safe area (bare ground, no overhanging branches)
   - Wind break if breezy
   - Stable surface for container

2. **Fire structure:**
   - Start with small kindling
   - Add medium wood (arm-thickness)
   - Build to strong fire with good coals
   - You need **sustained heat**, not just flames

3. **Coal bed development:**
   - Let fire burn down to red-hot coals
   - Add hardwood logs to sides (create heat reflectors)
   - Center should have deep coal bed (10-15cm)

**Ready when:**

- Coals glowing red-orange
- Minimal flame, mostly radiant heat
- Can hold hand 30cm above for only 2-3 seconds
- Estimated temp: 400-500°C

### **Step 2: Place Container (Beginning of Pyrolysis)**

1. **Position in fire:**
   - Set container in center of coal bed
   - Nestle into coals (partial burial)
   - Coals should surround sides, not just under bottom

2. **Monitor immediately:**
   - Point IR thermometer at container side
   - Initial temp: Will climb from ambient
   - Target: Reach 400°C and stabilize

3. **First signs (5-10 minutes in):**
   - **Thin smoke from vent hole** - Water vapor and volatiles escaping
   - Smoke will be white-gray initially (water steam)
   - Container exterior may steam slightly

### **Step 3: Active Pyrolysis Phase (30-60 minutes)**

**Temperature progression:**

**Phase 1: Drying (100-200°C, 10-15 min)**

- Thick white steam from vent
- Hissing sounds possible
- Container may vibrate slightly

**Phase 2: Initial breakdown (200-350°C, 10-15 min)**

- Smoke becomes yellow-brown
- Strong smell (organic compounds volatilizing)
- Smoke volume increases

**Phase 3: Active pyrolysis (350-500°C, 20-30 min)**

- **Bright orange-yellow flames** from vent hole (combustible gases igniting)
- This is GOOD - shows proper pyrolysis
- Container glows dull red if visible through fire
- Significant smoke/gas production

**Phase 4: Completion (500-550°C, 5-10 min)**

- Flames from vent diminish
- Smoke becomes wispy, thin
- Color shifts blue-gray (less volatile content)
- Container maintains steady glow

**Temperature control:**

**If too hot (>550°C):**

- Pull container to edge of coals (reduce heat)
- Remove some coals from around sides
- Don't open lid (oxygen entry = combustion)

**If too cool (<400°C):**

- Add more coals around container
- Add wood to fire (build more coals)
- May need to wait longer for proper pyrolysis

**Visual temperature guide (without thermometer):**

- **No glow:** <400°C - Too cool, not pyrolyzing
- **Dull red glow:** 400-500°C - Perfect range
- **Bright red glow:** 500-600°C - Good but watch carefully
- **Orange glow:** >600°C - Too hot, pull back

### **Step 4: Completion Signs (How to Know It's Done)**

**Primary indicators:**

1. **Smoke/flame from vent stops:**
   - Should see only slight heat shimmer
   - No visible smoke
   - No flames

2. **Time elapsed:**
   - Minimum 45 minutes total
   - Typically 60-90 minutes
   - Very dry material may finish faster

3. **Sound:**
   - Initial popping/crackling stops
   - Quiet except fire sounds

**Confirmation test:**

- Remove container from fire (use tongs - VERY HOT)
- Look at vent hole from safe distance
- No smoke after 2-3 minutes = complete

### **Step 5: Cooling & Quenching**

**Critical: Must stop pyrolysis properly**

**Option 1: Air cooling (slower, safer)**

1. **Remove from fire:**
   - Use long tongs
   - Move to bare ground, far from fire (3m minimum)
   - Keep lid on (oxygen entry = combustion)

2. **Cool naturally:**
   - Takes 3-4 hours to reach safe handling temp
   - Can spray outside with water to speed up
   - Don't open lid until completely cool

3. **Ready when:**
   - Can touch container with bare hand
   - No steam/smoke when lid cracked open
   - Contents black and stable

**Option 2: Water quenching (faster, requires care)**

1. **Prepare quench bucket:**
   - Large metal bucket
   - Fill with water (20-30 liters)
   - Set on stable ground

2. **Transfer hot container:**
   - Use tongs to carry
   - Keep level (don't spill contents)
   - Move smoothly to bucket

3. **Submerge:**
   - Lower entire container into water
   - **Massive steam production** - stand back
   - Let water cool everything (30-60 minutes)

4. **Remove and drain:**
   - Lift out once cool enough to touch bucket
   - Open lid (underwater if possible)
   - Pour contents into separate container
   - Wet biochar is fine - will be dried later

**Safety note:**
Water quenching creates dramatic steam clouds. Do outdoors, upwind from people/buildings.

## Post-Pyrolysis Processing

### **Step 1: Initial Inspection**

**What you should see:**

- **Very dark black material** (lighter than wood biochar - more brown-black)
- **Maintains some humus structure** (not as fluffy as wood char)
- **Slightly heavier** than wood biochar (mineral content)
- **Dull surface** (not shiny like graphite)

**Signs of successful pyrolysis:**
✅ Completely black (no brown spots)  
✅ Brittle (crumbles easily)  
✅ No organic smell (should smell like charcoal)  
✅ Dry and stable (doesn't smolder or smoke)  

**Signs of problems:**

❌ **Brown patches** = Incomplete pyrolysis

- Can re-pyrolyze these pieces
- Or discard (won't be conductive)

❌ **White ash** = Over-pyrolyzed or combusted

- Means oxygen entered during process
- Ash has no conductivity - discard

❌ **Smoldering/smoking** = Still active

- Dunk in water immediately
- Cool completely before processing

### **Step 2: Crushing & Sizing**

**Goal: 2-5mm particle size for optimal electrode mixing**

1. **Coarse crushing:**
   - Empty cooled contents onto hard surface
   - Use hammer or rock to break large pieces
   - Don't pulverize to dust
   - Break to ~10mm chunks

2. **Screen through 10mm mesh:**
   - Shake/sift material
   - What passes through = correct size or smaller
   - What stays on screen = needs more crushing
   - Repeat until all passes 10mm

3. **Screen through 5mm mesh:**
   - Material smaller than 5mm passes through
   - Material 5-10mm stays on screen = perfect size
   - Material <5mm is acceptable but not ideal (too fine)

4. **Optional fine removal:**
   - Screen through 2mm mesh
   - Collect material that stays on screen
   - Discard or save dust for other uses
   - Electrode mix works best with 2-10mm particles

**Why size matters:**

- Too large (>10mm): Poor mixing with wood biochar, voids in electrode
- Too small (<1mm): Compacts, reduces porosity, limits microbial colonization
- Optimal (2-5mm): Good blending, maintains structure, maximum surface area

### **Step 3: Magnetic Testing (Quality Confirmation)**

**Confirms iron reduction during pyrolysis:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Spread ~50g biochar on white paper
   - Use strong neodymium magnet
   - Bring magnet close to biochar

2. **What to look for:**
   - **Particles visibly jump to magnet** = Excellent (strong Fe content)
   - **Particles shift toward magnet** = Good (moderate Fe)
   - **Slight movement only** = Marginal (low Fe but usable)
   - **No movement** = Problem (see troubleshooting)

3. **Compare to pre-pyrolysis:**
   - Raw humus when charred: Moderate attraction
   - Proper pyrolyzed humus: Strong attraction
   - Improvement = Fe successfully reduced to metallic form

### **Step 4: Washing (Removes Ash & Fines)**

**Why wash:**

- Removes surface ash (non-conductive)
- Eliminates ultra-fine particles (can clog pores)
- Cleans for better mixing with wood biochar

**Process:**

1. **First rinse:**
   - Place biochar in bucket
   - Cover with water
   - Stir vigorously
   - Let settle 30 seconds
   - Pour off cloudy water (contains fine ash)

2. **Repeat rinses:**
   - Add fresh water
   - Stir and settle
   - Pour off
   - Repeat 3-5 times until water stays relatively clear

3. **Final water:**
   - Will have slight brown tint (normal - tannins)
   - Shouldn't be thick or murky
   - If still very cloudy after 5 rinses, continue

### **Step 5: Drying**

**Essential before storage or use:**

**Sun drying (preferred, 2-3 days):**

1. Spread washed biochar thinly (2cm deep) on tarp
2. Place in full sun
3. Stir twice daily
4. Test: Squeeze handful - should be completely dry, not cool/damp

**Oven drying (faster, 6-8 hours):**

1. Spread on baking sheets
2. Set oven to 100-120°C
3. Dry until no steam visible
4. Cool before storing

**Campfire drying (fastest, 1-2 hours):**

1. Spread on metal sheet
2. Place near (not in) fire
3. Stir frequently
4. Watch that it doesn't ignite

### **Step 6: Storage**

**Container:**

- Airtight bucket or heavy-duty bag
- Prevents moisture reabsorption
- Protects from contamination

**Label clearly:**

```
SEIGR HUB - Fe-Humus Biochar
Pyrolysis date: [date]
Peak temp: [estimated]
Weight: [kg]
Magnetic test: Strong/Moderate/Weak
Ready for mixing with wood biochar
```

**Storage duration:**

- Indefinite if kept dry
- Check every few months for moisture
- Use within 1 year for best performance

## Expected Yield

**Starting material:**

- 1-1.5kg dry humus

**After pyrolysis:**

- 400-600g biochar (30-40% mass loss)
- This is normal (volatiles driven off)

**After washing & sizing:**

- 350-500g final product
- Enough for 25-35L Fe-humus biochar (at 30% humus ratio in high-output system)
- Or 6-8L for small 1m³ system
- Makes one large electrode or two medium electrodes

## Quality Benchmarks

**Successful Fe-humus biochar:**

✅ **Color:** Very dark black, slight brown tint acceptable  
✅ **Magnetic response:** Strong attraction to magnet  
✅ **Particle size:** 90% in 2-10mm range  
✅ **Conductivity:** 120-300 µS/cm (if testable)  
✅ **Structure:** Brittle, porous, lightweight  
✅ **Smell:** Slight smoky smell, no organic odor  
✅ **Feel:** Dry, dusty (if rubbed), leaves black marks on skin  

## Next Step

**Step 13: Blend Biochar Mix** - Combine this iron-enhanced biochar with wood biochar at optimal ratios for maximum electrode performance.

## Troubleshooting

**"No magnetic attraction after pyrolysis"**

- Humus may have been low in Fe originally
- Or pyrolysis temp too low (<400°C)
- Or incomplete pyrolysis (brown material remains)
- Solution: Re-pyrolyze same material at higher temp, or collect from different humus zone

**"Material is brown, not black"**

- Incomplete pyrolysis
- Solution: Put back in container, re-pyrolyze for 30-45 more minutes
- Can add to new batch of humus for next run

**"Lots of white ash mixed in"**

- Oxygen entered during pyrolysis (loose lid or large vent)
- Solution: Screen out ash (lighter, won't pass through fine mesh when shaken)
- Use tighter seal next time

**"Container cracked during heating"**

- Heated too fast, or material was too wet
- Solution: Use thicker container, slower heating, ensure complete drying pre-pyrolysis

**"Smoke never turned to flames at vent"**

- Temperature too low (<350°C)
- Solution: Build hotter fire, use more coals around container
- May need longer time to reach proper temp

## Safety Reminders

**During pyrolysis:**

- Never seal container completely (explosion risk)
- Always have fire extinguisher ready
- Keep children/pets away (hot surfaces, smoke)
- Work in well-ventilated area (gases released)
- Don't leave fire unattended

**After pyrolysis:**

- Hot container = severe burns (use welding gloves/tongs)
- Don't open hot container (flash combustion risk)
- Quenching creates steam (stand upwind)
- Store biochar away from open flames

**Working with biochar:**

- Wear dust mask (fine particles)
- Wash hands after handling
- Don't inhale dust
- Keep dry (wet biochar can mold)

---

**Time investment:**

- Setup: 30 minutes
- Pyrolysis: 60-90 minutes
- Cooling: 30 minutes (quench) or 3-4 hours (air)
- Processing: 45 minutes
- Total: 4-6 hours (mostly supervised waiting)

**Yield:**

- 350-500g iron-enhanced biochar from 1.5kg dry humus

**Next:** We'll blend this with wood biochar to create the ultimate electrode material!
