# Step 09: Construct Walls

## Objective

Build insulated, breathable walls for a 2m³ high-output unit that contain composting material while managing moisture, temperature, and airflow for optimal microbial fuel cell performance.

**Scale for high-output system:** This step builds walls for one 2m³ unit (1.6m × 1.6m × 1.25m high). For modular array, build each unit separately with shared insulation walls if positioned adjacent.

## Why This Matters

**Walls define the system environment:**

- **Containment** - Hold 800-1200kg biochar and compost in place (2m³ vs 400-600kg for 1m³)
- **Thermal insulation** - Retain metabolic heat (50-70°C) for microbial activity
- **Moisture regulation** - Allow controlled evaporation, prevent rain infiltration
- **Structural support** - Carry electrode mounting points (24 electrodes), wiring channels
- **Pest exclusion** - Prevent rodents, insects from disrupting system
- **Aesthetic integration** - Blend into forest environment (Seigr philosophy)

**Wall performance affects:**

- **Composting rate** - Insulated walls maintain thermophilic temperatures
- **Electrical output** - Stable temperature = consistent microbial metabolism
- **Lifespan** - Good moisture management prevents wood rot
- **Maintenance frequency** - Well-built walls need minimal intervention

**Norwegian climate challenges:**

- Cold winters (-15 to -25°C) - need good insulation
- High rainfall (800-1200mm/year) - need water resistance
- Freeze-thaw cycles - need structural flexibility
- Variable humidity - need breathability

## Wall Design

### **Type: Double-Wall Insulated Box**

**Why this design:**

- Inner wall (load-bearing) - contains compost pressure
- Outer wall (weather protection) - sheds rain, retains heat
- Insulation layer between - maintains temperature, reduces condensation
- Air gap at top - allows moisture vapor exit
- Simple joinery - minimal tools, easier construction

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Single-wall** - Simpler, but poor insulation, more temperature swing
- **Straw-bale** - Excellent insulation, but attracts rodents, degrades in 3-5 years
- **Rammed earth** - Thermal mass, but heavy, requires more foundation, not moveable

**Double-wall wins for:** Thermal performance + weather resistance + longevity

### **Dimensions:**

**External (outer wall):**

- 1.6m × 1.6m × 1.25m high
- Fits on 1.8m × 1.8m foundation with room to work
- Provides ~2m³ internal volume after walls/insulation

**Internal (inner wall):**

- 1.36m × 1.36m × 1.25m high
- Actual composting volume = ~2.3m³ (allows settling)

**Wall thickness:**

- Inner wall: 2cm boards
- Insulation gap: 8cm (filled with sawdust/wood chips)
- Outer wall: 2cm boards
- **Total wall thickness:** 12cm

**Access:**

- Removable top (entire lid lifts off)
- Or hinged lid (attached on one side)
- Front panel removable (for loading, harvesting compost)

## Materials Needed

**From forest/property (reclaimed or harvested):**

**For inner wall (load-bearing):**

- 65-80 boards: 1.36m long, 15-20cm wide, 2.5cm thick (heavier for higher load)
- Total: ~0.15m³ wood
- Can use: Rough-sawn lumber, storm-felled tree milled on-site (NOT reclaimed pallet wood - too light for 1000kg load)

**For outer wall (weather protection):**

- 65-80 boards: 1.6m long, 15-20cm wide, 2cm thick
- Total: ~0.16m³ wood
- Can use: Same as inner wall, or lower grade (knots okay)

**For corner posts (structural):**

- 8 pieces: 1.3m long, 6cm × 6cm (4 inner corners, 4 outer corners - heavier for taller walls)
- Or 4 pieces: 12cm × 12cm (combines inner/outer function, very strong)

**For top frame (lid support):**

- 8 pieces: 1.6m long, 6cm × 6cm (inner and outer rim)

**Insulation material (loose-fill between walls):**

- 300-400L sawdust (from milling operations, free)
- Or wood chips (shredded branches, prunings)
- Or dry leaves, pine needles (less effective, but available)
- Or wood shavings (planer waste from carpentry)
- Larger volume needed: (1.6m perimeter × 4 sides × 1.25m height × 0.12m wall thickness)

**Purchased/salvaged materials:**

**Fasteners:**

- 200-300 screws: 50-75mm length (galvanized or stainless)
- Or nails: 60-80mm (if using hammer instead of drill)

**Weather protection (outer wall coating):**

- Linseed oil: 1-2L (natural, breathable, water-resistant)
- Or pine tar: 0.5-1L (traditional Scandinavian wood treatment)
- Or biochar tar: From pyrolysis in Step 12 (zero-cost option)

**Moisture barrier (between insulation and inner wall):**

- Landscape fabric or burlap: 7-8m² (breathable but prevents insulation from falling into compost)
- Or skip (sawdust compacts into its own barrier over time)

**Ventilation:**

- Hardware cloth or wire mesh: 0.5m² (covers vent holes, excludes pests)

**Tools required:**

- Saw (hand saw or circular saw)
- Drill with bits and screwdriver attachment
- Measuring tape, square, level
- Pencil for marking
- Clamps (hold boards while fastening)
- Staple gun (attach fabric/mesh)

## Construction Process

### **Phase 1: Inner Wall (Load-Bearing)**

**1. Build inner corner posts:**

- Cut 4 posts to 1.3m (5cm taller than wall for attachment to foundation and lid)
- Stand posts at 1.36m × 1.36m spacing on foundation (just inside drainage gravel area)
- Temporarily brace with diagonal scrap wood to keep vertical and square
- Attach bottom of posts to foundation joists with 2 screws each (angled)

**2. Attach inner wall boards (vertical orientation):**

- Start at one corner post
- Place first board flush against post, bottom edge on drainage gravel
- Pre-drill two holes (top and bottom), screw to post (50mm screws)
- Place next board tight against first board
- Screw to post
- Continue around all four sides
- Boards should reach ~1.25m height (trim if necessary)

**3. Add mid-height support (optional but recommended):**

- Horizontal band of 5cm × 5cm lumber at 50cm height
- Screwed to inside face of wall boards
- Prevents outward bulge from compost pressure
- Creates shelf for electrode mounting (useful later)

**4. Check for plumb and square:**

- Use level on each wall face (should be vertical)
- Measure diagonals of top opening (should be equal)
- Adjust bracing if needed, then secure firmly

### **Phase 2: Insulation Layer**

**5. Attach moisture barrier to inner wall (if using):**

- Cut landscape fabric to wrap around outer face of inner wall
- Staple to top edge of inner wall boards
- Let fabric drape down exterior
- Overlaps at corners (prevents sawdust infiltration)

**6. Build outer corner posts:**

- Cut 4 posts to 1.6m
- Position 12cm away from inner posts (creating insulation gap)
- Attach to foundation
- Brace temporarily

**7. Create insulation retainer at bottom:**

- Attach a "toe board" (5cm × 10cm board laid flat) around base of outer posts
- This creates a shelf that holds insulation above foundation
- Allows drainage gravel to remain separate from insulation

**8. Partially fill insulation gap:**

- Pour sawdust/wood chips into gap as you build outer wall
- Fill in 20-30cm increments (prevents settling voids)
- Tamp lightly (not too dense - air pockets add insulation value)

### **Phase 3: Outer Wall (Weather Protection)**

**9. Attach outer wall boards (vertical orientation):**

- Same process as inner wall
- Boards slightly longer (1.6m to cover full height including insulation gap)
- Screw to outer corner posts
- Fill insulation gap progressively as wall rises

**10. Create ventilation slots:**

- Near top of outer wall (90-100cm height), leave 5-10mm gaps between every 3rd board
- Cover gaps with hardware cloth (stapled over gaps from inside)
- Allows moisture vapor escape, prevents pest entry
- Alternatively: Drill 10-15 holes (2cm diameter) near top, cover with mesh

**11. Complete insulation filling:**

- Top off insulation to full height
- Lightly tamp to settle
- Should be 3-5cm below top edge (room for lid frame)

### **Phase 4: Top Frame and Lid**

**12. Build inner top frame:**

- 4 pieces: 1.36m long, 6cm × 6cm
- Form square resting on top of inner wall
- Attach to inner corner posts
- Provides support for electrode access, keeps compost from overflowing

**13. Build outer top frame:**

- 4 pieces: 1.6m long, 6cm × 6cm
- Form square resting on top of outer wall
- Attach to outer corner posts
- Creates weather overhang

**14. Construct lid (removable cover):**

- Frame: 4 pieces of 5cm × 5cm forming 1.25m × 1.25m square (slightly larger than outer wall)
- Decking: 8-10 boards (1.25m × 15cm × 2cm) screwed across frame
- Overhang: Extends 2-3cm beyond outer wall on all sides (rain drip edge)
- Handles: Attach rope or wood handles on two sides (for lifting)
- Weight: ~15-20kg (can be lifted by one person, easier with two)

**15. Weather-proof the lid:**

- Coat top surface with linseed oil or pine tar (3 coats)
- Pay special attention to end grain (most water-absorbent)
- Ensure overlaps and edges are sealed

**16. Hinge or leave removable:**

- **Removable** (simpler): Just lift off when accessing system
- **Hinged** (more convenient): Attach heavy-duty hinges to rear edge, opens like a chest
- If hinged, add a latch or hook on front edge (keeps closed in wind)

### **Phase 5: Front Access Panel**

**17. Make front panel removable:**

- Bottom 3-5 boards on front wall (30-50cm height) remain unfastened or lightly fastened
- These can be removed to shovel out finished compost from bottom
- Hold in place with removable screws or slide-in-groove system
- Labeled "HARVEST PANEL" for future reference

### **Phase 6: Finishing Touches**

**18. Weather-proof exterior:**

- Brush linseed oil onto all outer wall boards (2-3 coats)
- Focus on joints, end grain, anywhere water can penetrate
- Dries in 24-48 hours per coat
- Gives wood honey color, enhances natural grain

**19. Install wire channels:**

- Route for electrode wires to exit wall
- Drill 2-3cm holes near base of one wall
- Insert rubber grommet or wrap wires in fabric (prevents chafing)
- These channels will be used in Steps 20-23 (electrical connections)

**20. Add identification:**

- Burn or paint "Seigr Hub MFC-01" on outer wall (front or side)
- Date of construction
- Personal touch (builder name, symbol, quote)

**21. Final inspection and cleanup:**

- Walk around system, check all joints (tight? screws secure?)
- Test lid (lifts easily? seals well?)
- Remove construction debris, organize tools
- Sweep foundation deck

## Quality Checks

After completing this step, you should have:

✅ **Inner wall is plumb and square** (vertical sides, 90° corners)  
✅ **Outer wall is weather-resistant** (oiled, no gaps)  
✅ **Insulation is full and settled** (no voids)  
✅ **Lid fits and seals** (small overhang, easy to remove)  
✅ **Ventilation is functional** (mesh-covered slots or holes)  
✅ **Front panel is removable** (access for compost harvest)  
✅ **Wire channels are installed** (ready for electrical work)  
✅ **Structure is stable** (no wobble, strong joints)  

## Timeline

**Wall construction:** 2-3 days

- Inner wall: 4-6 hours
- Insulation and outer wall: 4-6 hours
- Top frame and lid: 2-4 hours
- Finishing: 2-3 hours (plus drying time for oil coats)

## Troubleshooting

**"Boards are warped or uneven thickness"**

- Use thicker boards for inner wall (needs strength)
- Outer wall can tolerate more variation (weather protection is main role)
- Plane down high spots if you have access to planer
- Fill gaps with sawdust mixed with wood glue (creates seal)

**"Insulation settles, creating void at top"**

- Normal - happens as sawdust compacts from vibration
- Top off with more sawdust every few months for first year
- Eventually stabilizes
- Or use wood chips (larger particles, less settling)

**"Lid is too heavy to lift easily"**

- Build in two sections (hinged in middle like barn doors)
- Or make front half removable, back half hinged
- Or add pulley system (rope over branch, counterweight)

**"Moisture condenses on inner wall"**

- Expected in first weeks as system activates
- Increases insulation thickness (more sawdust)
- Ensure ventilation slots are open
- May indicate compost is too wet (reduce water additions)

**"Rodents try to burrow into insulation"**

- Install hardware cloth (wire mesh) on bottom edge of outer wall
- Bury mesh 10-15cm into ground around foundation
- Create barrier they can't chew through
- Check mesh coverings on ventilation holes (secure stapling)

**"Wood starts to rot at base"**

- Likely from splash-back or poor drainage
- Ensure foundation drainage is working (check gravel layer)
- Add drip edge (angled trim) at bottom of outer wall
- Re-coat with linseed oil or tar (refreshes water resistance)

**"Walls bulge outward from compost weight"**

- Add horizontal support bands inside (5cm × 5cm lumber at 33cm and 66cm heights)
- Screw through wall boards into bands
- Tighten corner posts to foundation
- If severe, rebuild inner wall with thicker boards (3cm instead of 2cm)

**"Can't source enough lumber"**

- Scavenge pallets (disassemble for boards)
- Check Finn.no (Norwegian classifieds) for free/cheap lumber
- Ask at sawmills for slab wood (free offcuts)
- Delay build until you've collected enough (patience is Seigr philosophy)

## Design Variations

**Hexagonal or octagonal walls:**

- More elegant, better internal volume for given perimeter
- More complex joinery (angled cuts)
- Requires more planning and precision
- Aesthetic preference over functional need

**Cob or earthen walls:**

- Ultra-sustainable (clay + sand + straw)
- Excellent thermal mass
- Requires plastering, maintenance to prevent erosion
- Best for permanent installations in stable locations

**Stacked stone walls:**

- Very durable (20+ year lifespan)
- Heavy (needs strong foundation)
- Excellent drainage (natural air gaps)
- Time-intensive to build
- Beautiful integration in forest setting

**Woven willow/wattle walls:**

- Traditional, zero-cost if willow available
- Requires annual maintenance (weaving loosens)
- Shorter lifespan (5-7 years)
- Aesthetically striking, very "Seigr"

## Seasonal Considerations

**Temperature management through walls:**

**Winter (cold exterior, hot compost interior):**

- Large temperature gradient drives heat loss
- Good insulation (12cm sawdust) reduces loss
- Compost stays 40-60°C even when exterior is -20°C
- Condensation forms on inner wall (moisture migrates to cold side)
- Ventilation important to release moisture vapor

**Summer (warm exterior, hot compost interior):**

- Smaller gradient, less heat loss
- Compost can overheat (>70°C) if very active
- Increase ventilation (remove lid during day)
- Outer wall reflects sun (light color helps)

**Spring/Fall (moderate, variable):**

- Most stable conditions
- Monitor moisture (rain increases, need good drainage)
- Comfortable working temperature for maintenance

## Maintenance

**Monthly:**

- Check lid seal (reseat if shifted)
- Inspect outer wall for moisture damage
- Clear leaves/debris from around base (airflow)

**Annually:**

- Re-coat outer wall with oil (refreshes weather protection)
- Tighten any loose screws
- Top off insulation if settled
- Check wire channels (clear of debris)

**5-year:**

- Replace outer wall boards if rotting (most exposed)
- Refresh insulation completely (old sawdust may compact, lose R-value)
- Inspect and replace fasteners (rust, corrosion)

## Important Notes

**Walls create the microclimate:**

- Too much insulation = overheating risk
- Too little insulation = temperature swings, reduced performance
- 8-12cm insulation is sweet spot for Norwegian climate

**Breathability is critical:**

- Walls must allow moisture vapor to escape
- Using plastic sheeting or sealant causes anaerobic conditions (bad smell, low power)
- Wood and fabric are naturally breathable (ideal)

**Adaptability built-in:**

- Removable panels allow future modifications
- Can add electrode mounting points as needed
- System evolves based on observed performance

**Forest aesthetics matter:**

- This structure will be visible for 7-10 years
- Natural wood, earth tones, simple design = blends in
- Sharp corners, bright paint, complex shapes = stands out (counter to Seigr low-impact philosophy)

**This step anchors the system physically:**

- Foundation (Step 08) supports it from below
- Walls (this step) define it in space
- Electrodes (Steps 14-16) will inhabit this space
- Walls are the skeleton; next we add the organs

---

**Walls complete - containment secured!**

With insulated, weather-resistant walls standing on a stable foundation, we now have a controlled environment ready to house our biogeochemical reactor. The physical structure is complete - next we shift to preparing the biological and electrochemical components that will bring it to life.

Next: **Step 10 - Install Drainage** (finalizing the moisture management system that enables both composting and electricity generation).
