# Step 20: Fill System with Compost and Organic Matter

## Objective

Fill the 2m³ system with stratified organic matter around installed electrodes, creating the microbial habitat and "fuel" that generates continuous electrical power while processing waste.

**Scale for high-output system:** This step adds ~1.8-2.0m³ of organic material (800-1200kg) in carefully layered zones optimized for anode (organic-rich) and cathode (oxygen-rich) performance.

## Why This Matters

**Compost composition determines power output:**
- **Carbon content** - Fuels microbial metabolism (electrons come from carbon oxidation)
- **Nitrogen content** - Enables protein synthesis (microbes need N to grow)
- **Moisture** - Medium for ion transport (dry compost = no current flow)
- **Aeration** - Cathodes need O₂, anodes need low O₂ (stratification is critical)
- **pH** - Affects microbial activity and electrode chemistry (target 6.5-7.5)
- **Particle size** - Controls airflow, moisture retention, settling rate

**Poor filling causes:**
- Anaerobic zones around cathodes (O₂ starvation = no electron acceptance)
- Aerobic zones around anodes (O₂ presence = microbes use O₂ instead of electrodes)
- Compaction (crushes electrode structures, blocks water flow)
- Dry pockets (microbes die, electrical resistance soars)
- Acidification (pH <5.5 inhibits most electricity-generating bacteria)
- System output: 30-50% of potential

**For 200-400W target system:**
- Proper filling enables design performance
- Improper filling = system becomes ordinary composter with minimal power (<20W)

## Understanding Compost Zones and Gradients

### **Vertical Stratification (Bottom to Top):**

**Zone 1: Drainage Layer (0-25cm)** - Already installed in Step 10
- Moraine pH buffer + gravel
- Function: Leachate collection, metal filtration
- No organic matter here

**Zone 2: Lower Anode Zone (25-70cm)** - Contains Layer 1 electrodes (50cm)
- Material: High-carbon, well-aged compost + wood chips
- Moisture: 60-70% (slightly wet)
- Aeration: Low (compacted, anaerobic-favoring)
- **Why:** Anodes perform best in oxygen-depleted, organic-rich zones
- Cathodes in this layer positioned at edges (access oxygen from sides)

**Zone 3: Mid-Transition Zone (70-105cm)** - Contains Layer 2 electrodes (90cm)
- Material: Mixed compost + straw + fresh inputs
- Moisture: 55-65% (optimal)
- Aeration: Moderate (balanced)
- **Why:** Highest microbial activity zone, peak heat generation
- Both anodes and cathodes have good access to their needs

**Zone 4: Upper Cathode Zone (105-125cm)** - Contains Layer 3 electrodes (120cm)
- Material: Lighter, bulkier mix + fresh inputs
- Moisture: 50-60% (not saturated)
- Aeration: High (fluffy, oxygen-permeable)
- **Why:** Cathodes get maximum O₂ from surface air
- Anodes process fresh organic additions

### **Horizontal Gradients (Center to Edge):**

**Center areas (where anodes cluster):**
- Denser packing
- More carbon-rich materials
- Lower oxygen (anaerobic metabolism)
- Higher temperature

**Edge areas (where cathodes cluster):**
- Looser packing
- More bulking agents (straw, chips)
- Higher oxygen (aerobic-leaning)
- Lower temperature

## Materials Needed

- **Spray hose or watering can:** Add moisture
- **pH test strips or meter:** Monitor acidity
- **Thermometer:** Long probe (measure internal temperature)
- **Gloves:** Hand protection
- **Dust mask:** For dry materials handling

## Filling Process

### **Phase 1: Prepare Materials and Plan Zones (1-2 hours)**

**1. Assess available materials:**
- Lay out all organic materials
- Estimate volumes (measure in wheelbarrows or bags)
- Check moisture of each component:
  - **Compost:** Should be damp (50-60% moisture)
  - **Wood chips:** Usually dry (<20% moisture)
  - **Straw:** Very dry (<10% moisture)

**2. Pre-mix base blend:**

**Recipe for Lower Anode Zone (25-70cm depth, 45cm thick):**
- Well-aged compost: 300L (60%)
- Wood chips (small): 100L (20%)
- Sawdust: 50L (10%)
- Forest soil: 50L (10%)
- **Total: 500L for lower zone**

**Mix in wheelbarrow or on tarp:**
- Combine dry components first
- Break up clumps
- Aim for uniform distribution

**3. Pre-mix mid-transition blend:**

**Recipe for Mid-Transition Zone (70-105cm depth, 35cm thick):**
- Well-aged compost: 250L (55%)
- Wood chips (mixed size): 100L (22%)
- Straw (chopped): 50L (11%)
- Shredded paper: 30L (7%)
- Forest soil: 20L (5%)
- **Total: 450L for mid zone**

**4. Pre-mix upper cathode blend:**

**Recipe for Upper Cathode Zone (105-125cm depth, 20cm thick):**
- Well-aged compost: 150L (45%)
- Wood chips (coarse): 100L (30%)
- Straw: 50L (15%)
- Shredded cardboard: 30L (10%)
- **Total: 330L for upper zone**

**Total material needs: ~1300L (1.3m³) plus void space between electrodes = fills 1.8-2.0m³ system**

### **Phase 2: Fill Lower Anode Zone (25-70cm) - 2-3 hours**

**Note:** In Step 19, we added interim 15-20cm compost layers. We'll now integrate those and complete the zone.

**5. Complete Lower Zone around Layer 1 electrodes (50cm height):**

**Current state:**
- Layer 1 electrodes installed at 50cm
- ~15cm interim compost below them (added in Step 19)
- Need to add ~30cm more (brings total to 45cm thick zone)

**Filling technique:**
- Scoop lower anode blend into system
- Pour gently around electrodes (don't disturb their positions)
- **Around anodes (center):** Pack moderately (creates denser, lower-O₂ environment)
- **Around cathodes (edges):** Pack loosely (allows peripheral airflow)
- Fill to 70cm height (20cm above Layer 1 electrodes)

**Moisture addition:**
- As you fill, mist layers with water
- Target: Squeeze test produces 1-2 drops (60-70% moisture)
- If too dry: Spray more water
- If too wet: Add dry sawdust or wood chips

**6. Create cathode air channels:**

At the 4 cathode positions (E1, E2, E3, E4):
- As you fill around them, insert vertical bundles of coarse straw or bamboo stakes
- These create permanent air channels from periphery to cathode
- Remove stakes after filling (leaves void for O₂ diffusion)
- Or leave bamboo stakes in place (they'll compost slowly)

**7. Gentle compaction:**
- After filling to 70cm, walk slowly around perimeter
- Gentle foot pressure compacts slightly
- **Don't compact center heavily** (want some anaerobic zones for anodes)
- Goal: Eliminate large voids, not to compress densely

### **Phase 3: Fill Mid-Transition Zone (70-105cm) - 2-3 hours**

**8. Complete Mid-Zone around Layer 2 electrodes (90cm height):**

**Current state:**
- Layer 2 electrodes installed at 90cm
- ~15cm interim compost below them (from Step 19)
- Need to add ~20cm more below + 15cm above

**Filling sequence:**
- Add mid-transition blend around and below Layer 2 electrodes
- Bring level up to 85cm (just below electrodes)
- Then carefully fill around electrode sides and over top
- Final height: 105cm (15cm above Layer 2 electrodes)

**Special attention to Layer 2:**
- This is the peak activity zone (highest temperature)
- Balance aeration around cathodes (E5-E8) with organic density around anodes (E17-E20)
- Use slightly more straw/bulking agent here (prevents excessive compaction from heat)

**9. Moisture check at depth:**
- Insert long probe or stick to 50cm depth
- Pull out and check moisture on probe
- Should be damp throughout
- If dry patches detected: Pour 5-10L water slowly at that spot, let percolate

### **Phase 4: Fill Upper Cathode Zone (105-125cm) - 1-2 hours**

**10. Complete Upper Zone around Layer 3 electrodes (120cm height):**

**This is the surface layer - most visible, most accessible for additions:**

**Filling sequence:**
- Add upper cathode blend around and below Layer 3 electrodes
- Bring to 118cm (just below electrodes)
- Fill around and over electrodes
- Final height: 123-125cm (top surface 2-5cm below system rim)

**Leave air space at top:**
- Don't overfill to rim
- 2-5cm air gap allows:
  - Fresh air circulation to cathodes
  - Room for material settlement (will compact 5-10cm in first month)
  - Space to add fresh food waste periodically

**11. Create surface aeration layer:**

Top 5cm (120-125cm):
- Use extra-coarse material (large wood chips, straw)
- Creates oxygen-rich surface zone
- Cathodes in Layer 3 benefit most from this

**12. Surface finishing:**
- Rake top level (smooth appearance)
- Create slight center mound (prevents rain pooling)
- Leave wire collection point accessible
- Don't cover walls or rim

### **Phase 5: Initial Moisture Saturation and Testing (1-2 hours)**

**13. Deep watering:**

**Why needed:** Dry pockets deep in system won't self-moisten

**Technique:**
- Insert 3-5 vertical pipes (PVC or bamboo, 2-3cm diameter) to different depths
- Pour water down pipes: 10-20L per pipe
- Water distributes horizontally from pipe exits
- Remove pipes or leave in place (can use for ongoing moisture additions)

**Total water added:**
- During filling: 50-100L (misting layers)
- Deep watering: 50-100L (vertical pipes)
- **Total initial moisture input: 100-200L**

**14. Drainage test:**
- Wait 2-4 hours after deep watering
- Check drainage outlet (from Step 10)
- **Should see:** Slow dripping (5-20 drops/minute)
- **If no drainage:** System may be too dry (add more water)
- **If heavy flow:** Too wet (wait 24 hours for absorption, then recheck)

**15. Temperature monitoring setup:**
- Insert long thermometer probe to mid-depth (90cm)
- Record baseline temperature (~ambient, 10-20°C)
- Mark probe location for future measurements
- **Expected rise:** 35-55°C within 3-7 days (thermophilic composting begins)

**16. pH test:**
- Collect small sample from drainage outlet
- Or extract sample from top 20cm with scoop
- Test with pH strips or meter
- **Target:** 6.0-7.5
- **If <6.0 (too acidic):** Add 200-500g wood ash, mix into top layer
- **If >8.0 (too alkaline):** Add sulfur or peat (rare in new systems)

**17. Final electrode continuity check:**
- Before system is fully buried, retest all 24 electrode wires
- Multimeter in resistance mode
- Wire to biochar surface (insert probe into compost at electrode location)
- **Expected:** 50-300Ω (higher than before filling due to compost conductivity)
- **If >1000Ω:** Possible wire damage during filling, investigate

### **Phase 6: Cover and Initial Settlement (1-7 days)**

**18. Install system lid or cover:**
- If system has lid (from Step 09): Place on top
- Ensure vent holes are open (gas escape, O₂ entry)
- If no lid: Cover with tarp, weighted at edges
- Leave small gaps for air circulation

**19. Monitor settlement:**
- **Day 1-2:** Rapid settlement (5-10cm typical)
- **Day 3-7:** Slower settlement (another 3-5cm)
- **Total first week:** Expect 8-15cm compaction

**As settlement occurs:**
- Top up with additional compost/bulking mix
- Maintain 2-5cm below rim
- Keep wires accessible

**20. Temperature rise observation:**
- Check daily with probe thermometer
- **Expected progression:**
  - Day 1: 15-25°C (ambient)
  - Day 2-3: 30-45°C (mesophilic composting)
  - Day 4-7: 45-65°C (thermophilic peak)
  - Day 8-14: 40-50°C (stabilizing)

**If temperature doesn't rise:**
- Too dry (add 20-30L water)
- Not enough nitrogen (add 5-10kg fresh material)
- Too cold ambient (<5°C) (insulate system walls)

**21. Initial odor check:**
- **Good:** Earthy, forest floor, slight sweetness
- **Acceptable:** Slight ammonia (indicates active decomposition)
- **Bad:** Rotten eggs (sulfide = too wet/anaerobic)
- **If bad odor:** Aerate top 20cm, add dry straw, reduce moisture

## Material Ratios and Calculations

**Carbon to Nitrogen (C:N) ratio targets:**
- **Lower zone:** 25-30:1 (higher carbon for sustained anode fuel)
- **Mid zone:** 20-25:1 (balanced)
- **Upper zone:** 15-20:1 (more nitrogen for active decomposition)

**Typical component C:N ratios:**
- Wood chips: 400-500:1 (very high carbon)
- Straw: 80-100:1 (high carbon)
- Sawdust: 200-500:1 (high carbon)
- Aged compost: 15-25:1 (balanced)
- Food waste: 15-20:1 (balanced to nitrogen-rich)
- Paper: 170-200:1 (high carbon)

**Mixing for target C:N:**
- Combine high-C materials (chips, straw) with balanced compost
- Lower zone uses more high-C (chips, sawdust) = higher C:N
- Upper zone uses less high-C = lower C:N

**Moisture content by weight:**
- **Target:** 55-65% moisture
- **Test:** Squeeze handful tightly
  - <50%: Dry, crumbly, doesn't hold shape
  - 55-65%: Holds shape, 1-3 drops squeezed out
  - >70%: Drips freely, forms puddle

**Bulk density (affects settlement):**
- Loose fill: 0.3-0.4 g/cm³
- Moderate compaction: 0.4-0.5 g/cm³
- After settlement: 0.5-0.6 g/cm³
- Total system mass (filled): 900-1200kg

## Expected Results

**Filled system characteristics:**
- **Volume filled:** 1.8-2.0m³ (of 2.56m³ total system volume)
- **Material mass:** 900-1200kg (wet basis)
- **Moisture content:** 55-65%
- **Temperature (after 7 days):** 45-60°C at mid-depth
- **pH:** 6.5-7.5
- **Drainage:** Slow dripping (few drops per minute)
- **Settlement (first week):** 10-15cm

**Zone stratification:**
✅ **Lower zone (25-70cm):** Dense, high-carbon, anaerobic-favoring
✅ **Mid zone (70-105cm):** Balanced, active, peak temperature
✅ **Upper zone (105-125cm):** Loose, high-aeration, accessible for additions
✅ **Cathodes:** Positioned in higher-O₂ areas (edges, surface)
✅ **Anodes:** Positioned in lower-O₂ areas (center, depth)

**Quality indicators:**
✅ **Uniform moisture** throughout (no dry or waterlogged zones)
✅ **Temperature rise** within 3-7 days (composting active)
✅ **Earthy smell** (no foul odors)
✅ **Slow drainage** (water percolates but doesn't pool)
✅ **All electrodes accessible** (wires not buried or damaged)
✅ **2-5cm headspace** at rim (room for settlement and additions)

## Troubleshooting

**"System compacted too much after filling (>20cm settlement)"**
- Material was too fine or too wet
- Add more bulking agents (coarse wood chips, straw)
- Fluff top 30cm with pitchfork
- Accept some compaction (normal in first month)

**"Temperature didn't rise (stays at ambient)"**
- Too dry: Add 30-50L water
- Not enough nitrogen: Add 10-20kg fresh green material or food waste
- Too cold outside: Insulate walls with straw bales
- Too small volume: <1m³ systems struggle to self-heat (not your case at 2m³)

**"System is too wet (water pools on surface)"**
- Drainage layer clogged (unlikely if Step 10 done correctly)
- Too much water added
- Solution: Stop adding water, aerate top 20cm, add dry straw

**"Foul smell (rotten eggs, ammonia)"**
- Anaerobic throughout (lack of oxygen)
- Or too much nitrogen (excess food waste)
- Solution: Aerate with pitchfork, add carbon (sawdust, shredded paper), reduce moisture

**"Can't reach target moisture (material stays dry)"**
- Very coarse, absorbent materials (wood chips absorb slowly)
- Solution: Pre-soak bulking agents in water 12-24 hours before filling
- Or add water via vertical pipes, wait 24-48 hours for distribution

**"Electrode positions shifted during filling"**
- Filling was too aggressive (heavy dumping)
- Support structures weak or unsecured
- Check electrode positions (should still be ~400mm spacing)
- If severely displaced: May need to partially empty, reposition, refill (major work, avoid if possible)

**"Wire got buried or lost"**
- Should be secured to wall (from Step 19)
- If buried: Carefully excavate from wire collection point downward
- Use wire to trace back to electrode
- Re-secure along wall

**"pH is very acidic (<5.5) immediately after filling"**
- Compost or materials were acidic to start
- Add 500g-1kg wood ash, mix into top 30cm
- Retest in 2-3 days
- Moraine buffer (Step 10) will neutralize over time

## Ongoing Material Addition Strategy

**After initial filling and 2-4 week activation period:**

**Weekly additions (optional but extends system life):**
- Fresh food waste: 1-3 kg/week (your actual waste stream)
- Add to top layer only
- Bury under 5cm compost or wood chips (reduces odor, pests)
- Distributes around Layer 3 anodes (fresh fuel)

**Monthly maintenance (if adding fresh waste):**
- Top up system as material settles
- Add 10-20L bulking mix per month
- Maintains 2-5cm headspace

**Annual replenishment (for continuous operation):**
- After 12 months, top 30cm will be well-decomposed
- Remove and use as garden compost
- Replace with fresh mix
- Lower layers remain undisturbed (electrodes embedded, working)

## Connection to Next Steps

**Step 20 outputs (filled system) enable:**

**→ Step 21 (Seal and Insulate):**
- System structure complete, ready for weatherproofing
- Insulation preserves heat generated by composting

**→ Step 24 (Monitor Drainage and Heavy Metal Capture):**
- Filled system begins producing leachate
- Drainage filtration becomes active

**→ Step 26 (Install Thermal Harvesting):**
- Composting heat (45-65°C) available for Peltier modules
- Temperature gradients enable +50-100W thermal power

**→ Step 27 (Activate System and Monitor):**
- Microbial colonization begins (2-4 weeks)
- Electrical output starts appearing (initially low, builds over weeks)

The filled system is now a **living bioelectrical reactor** - microbes will colonize the biochar electrodes, organic matter will decompose, and electrons will begin flowing. The power generation journey has begun!
