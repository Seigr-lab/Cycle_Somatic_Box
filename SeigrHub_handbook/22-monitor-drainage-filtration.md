# Step 22: Monitor Drainage and Install Heavy Metal Filtration

## Objective

Establish a system for monitoring leachate output, capturing dissolved heavy metals in biochar filters, and safely managing liquid effluent from the bioelectrical compost system.

**For high-output system:** Proper drainage prevents waterlogging (which kills aerobic cathode microbes and drops output by 40-70%), while heavy metal filtration ensures long-term safety and electrode longevity.

## Why This Matters

**Drainage management is critical for:**

- **Moisture balance** - System needs 55-65% moisture (too wet = anaerobic throughout, cathodes fail)
- **Ion transport** - Water carries ions between electrodes (dry system = high resistance, low current)
- **Leachate removal** - Excess water must exit or system drowns
- **Preventing acidification** - Organic acids accumulate in stagnant water (pH drops, microbes die)

**Heavy metal filtration protects:**

- **Human health** - Fe, Mn can leach from electrodes (especially early on)
- **Environment** - Discharge must be clean (Norwegian environmental standards)
- **System longevity** - Removing metals prevents electrode fouling, precipitation on cathodes
- **Reuse potential** - Filtered leachate can be recycled as moisture source or fertilizer

**Without proper drainage:**

- System floods (cathodes submerged = no O₂ = no electron acceptance)
- Output drops to <30% of design
- Eventual system failure (4-8 weeks)

**Without filtration:**

- Iron and manganese in leachate (50-500 ppm typical)
- Cannot discharge to soil or water
- Toxic accumulation over time

## Understanding Leachate Characteristics

### **What is Leachate:**

**Leachate = liquid that percolates through compost and exits via drainage:**

- **Source:** Rainwater, moisture in organic matter, metabolic water production
- **Composition:**
  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC): 500-5000 mg/L
  - Nitrogen (NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻): 50-500 mg/L
  - Iron: 10-200 mg/L (from Fe-humus electrodes)
  - Manganese: 5-100 mg/L (from Mn cathode enhancements)
  - pH: 5.5-7.5 (varies with compost age)
  - Electrical conductivity: 2-10 mS/cm

### **Flow Rate:**

**Depends on moisture input vs evaporation:**

- **After rain (saturated):** 5-20 L/day (heavy flow)
- **Normal operation (balanced):** 0.5-2 L/day (slow drip)
- **Dry period (no rain):** 0.1-0.5 L/day (minimal)
- **Winter (frozen surface):** 0 L/day (no flow)

**For 2m³ system:**

- Average leachate production: 1-3 L/day (varies seasonally)
- Annual total: 300-1000 L

### **Heavy Metal Concerns:**

**Iron (from Fe-humus biochar):**

- Initial concentration: 50-200 mg/L (first few months)
- Stabilizes: 10-50 mg/L (after 6+ months)
- **Norwegian discharge limit (soil):** 5 mg/L
- **Filtration needed:** Yes, especially first year

**Manganese (from cathode enhancements):**

- Initial concentration: 20-100 mg/L
- Stabilizes: 5-20 mg/L
- **Norwegian limit:** 1 mg/L (drinking water), 5 mg/L (discharge)
- **Filtration needed:** Yes

**Other metals (trace):**

- Zinc, copper, lead (from organic matter): <1-5 mg/L
- Usually within safe limits
- Biochar filtration removes these as well

- **Function:** Irrigates plants, final nutrient uptake

### **Tools:**

- **Drill with hole saw:** Create filter inlet/outlet
- **Saw:** Cut PVC pipe
- **Wrench:** Tighten fittings
- **Funnel:** Pour media into filter column
- **Measuring cups:** Portion filter media

## Installation Process

### **Phase 1: Drainage Monitoring Setup (1 hour)**

**1. Locate drainage outlet:**

- From Step 10, system has drainage pipe exiting at base
- Should be 2-3cm diameter PVC pipe
- Typically at one corner of foundation

**2. Position collection bucket:**

- Place 20-30L bucket under drainage outlet
- Elevate bucket on blocks (if needed) to ensure outlet is above bucket rim
- Allows gravity flow

**3. Extend drainage pipe (if needed):**

- If outlet is too close to ground: Add pipe extension
- Route into bucket opening
- Secure with clamps or weights

**4. Mark measurement intervals on bucket:**

- Use permanent marker or tape
- Mark lines at 1L, 2L, 5L, 10L, etc.
- Allows quick visual reading of collected volume

**5. Install lid on bucket:**

- Prevents rain dilution, debris entry, evaporation
- Cut hole for drainage pipe to enter
- Cover with screen (blocks insects)

### **Phase 2: Initial Drainage Observation (1-2 weeks)**

**6. Monitor daily for first week:**

- **Each day:** Check bucket level
- Record:
  - Date and time
  - Volume collected since last check (read from marks)
  - Weather (rain, dry, temperature)
  - Observations (color, clarity, odor)

**Example log:**
```
Date       | Volume (L) | Weather        | Notes
-----------|------------|----------------|------------------
Day 1      | 0.2        | Dry, 18°C      | Light brown, earthy smell
Day 2      | 0.5        | Rain 10mm      | Darker, more flow
Day 3      | 1.8        | Heavy rain     | Peaked, then slowed
Day 4      | 0.3        | Dry            | Back to baseline
...
```

**7. Sample and test leachate:**

**After 3-5 days of collection (sufficient volume):**

- Pour 100-200ml into clean jar or bottle
- **pH test:** Dip strip or use meter
  - **Expected:** 5.5-7.5
  - **If <5.5 (acidic):** System may need pH adjustment (add wood ash to compost)
  - **If >8.0 (alkaline):** Unusual, check moraine buffer (may be excessive)

- **Visual clarity:**
  - **Clear to light brown:** Good (low suspended solids)
  - **Dark brown/black:** High DOC (normal in early stages)
  - **Cloudy:** Suspended particles (not ideal, but biochar will filter)

- **Odor:**
  - **Earthy, mild:** Good
  - **Strong ammonia:** Excess nitrogen (not harmful, but indicates imbalance)
  - **Rotten, sulfur:** Anaerobic conditions (address system aeration)

**8. Determine baseline flow rate:**

- Average daily flow over first week
- **Example:** 0.5L + 1.2L + 0.8L + 0.3L + 0.6L + 1.0L + 0.4L = 4.8L / 7 days = **0.69 L/day average**
- This is your baseline (will vary with season)

### **Phase 3: Build Biochar Filter Column (2-3 hours)**

**9. Cut PVC pipe for filter housing:**

- **Length:** 60-80cm (longer = more contact time, better filtration)
- **Diameter:** 15-20cm (matches flow rate - larger diameter = slower flow = more time for adsorption)

**10. Install bottom cap and screen:**

- Glue PVC cap to bottom with PVC cement
- Drill 10-15 small holes (5-8mm) in bottom cap (water outlet, prevents media escape)
- Inside cap, place mesh screen (covers holes, holds media)

**11. Install outlet fitting:**

- Drill hole in bottom cap (slightly off-center, to side)
- Insert threaded barb fitting or PVC elbow
- Cement in place
- Attach short tube (outlet to final discharge)

**12. Layer filter media (bottom to top):**

**Layer 1 (bottom): Gravel support (10cm thick)**

- Pour 3-5L of 10-20mm gravel
- Tamp gently (creates stable base)

**Layer 2: Coarse sand (15cm thick)**

- Pour 5-10L of 0.5-2mm sand
- Distributes flow, filters fine particles

**Layer 3: Biochar (main filter) (30-40cm thick)**

- Pour 10-15L of 3-10mm biochar
- This is the critical heavy metal adsorption layer
- Use biochar from electrode prep scraps OR prepare fresh batch:
  - Same recipe as Step 11 (wood biochar) or Step 12 (Fe-humus biochar)
  - No need for ultrafine grinding (coarse is better for flow)

**Layer 4 (top): Gravel cap (5cm thick)**

- Pour 1-2L gravel
- Prevents incoming water from disturbing biochar surface

**13. Install top screen and cap:**

- Place mesh screen on top of gravel cap
- Loosely fit top cap (don't cement - need to access media for replacement)
- Drill hole in top cap for inlet tube

**14. Install inlet:**

- Insert tube through top cap hole
- Should extend down to just above gravel cap (disperses flow)
- Or: Use sprinkler head or perforated pipe (distributes across surface)

### **Phase 4: Connect Drainage to Filter (1 hour)**

**15. Route leachate from collection bucket to filter inlet:**

- **Option A: Gravity flow**
  - Elevate filter column above final discharge point
  - Place collection bucket above filter inlet
  - Siphon from bucket to filter with tube

- **Option B: Manual batch processing**
  - Collect leachate in bucket
  - Once per day (or when bucket fills), pour into filter top
  - Simpler, no continuous plumbing

**16. Install flow control:**

- On filter outlet, add valve or adjustable clamp
- Target flow rate: **Slow drip** (1-5 L/hour through filter)
- **Why slow:** Gives biochar time to adsorb metals (fast flow = poor contact = metals pass through)

**Calculating residence time:**

- Filter volume: ~12L (biochar + sand + voids)
- Flow rate: 2 L/hour
- Residence time: 12L / 2 L/hr = 6 hours
- **Goal:** 4-8 hours minimum for effective adsorption

**17. Perform initial flow test:**

- Pour 5-10L clean water through filter
- Check for leaks, verify flow rate
- Adjust valve as needed
- Collect outlet water (will be dark at first - biochar fines washing out)

**18. Flush filter:**

- Run 20-30L clean water through (can do over several hours)
- Outlet water should become clearer
- Removes initial biochar dust, equilibrates media

### **Phase 5: Install Final Discharge System (1-2 hours)**

**19. Choose discharge method:**

**Method A: Infiltration bed (best for Norwegian context)**

**Location:**

- 2-5m from main system, downslope
- Not near well or drinking water source (>10m setback)
- In vegetated area (plants uptake nutrients)

**Construction:**

- Dig pit: 0.5m × 0.5m × 0.5m (0.125m³)
- Fill with 10-20mm gravel (80-100L)
- Route filter outlet tube to center of pit
- Cover pit with landscape fabric or mesh (prevents soil washing in)
- Cover with 5-10cm soil and vegetation

**Function:**

- Filtered leachate disperses into gravel
- Percolates slowly into soil
- Soil microbes and minerals provide final polishing (remove any remaining organics, metals)
- Plants uptake nutrients (N, P, K)

**Method B: Collection tank for reuse**

**Setup:**

- Place 50-100L tank at filter outlet
- Route tube into tank
- Cover tank (prevents algae growth, mosquitoes)

**Use:**

- Dilute filtered leachate 1:5 with water (high nutrient concentration)
- Apply to garden as liquid fertilizer
- Or: Recycle back to compost system if moisture is low

**Method C: Direct irrigation**

**Setup:**

- Route filter outlet to perforated drip line
- Distribute along garden row or tree roots
- Leachate provides continuous fertigation

### **Phase 6: Ongoing Monitoring (Weekly, then Monthly)**

**20. Weekly drainage checks (first 3 months):**

- Measure leachate volume collected
- Note changes:
  - **Volume increase:** May indicate overwatering, excessive rain, or system saturation
  - **Volume decrease:** Drying out, or improved moisture retention
  - **Color changes:** Darkening (more DOC), lightening (aging, reduced activity)

**21. Monthly sampling and testing:**

- Collect leachate sample **before filter** (raw)
- Collect sample **after filter** (filtered)
- Test both for:
  - pH
  - Color/clarity (visual)
  - Optional: Fe, Mn concentration (if using test kit or lab)

**Example comparison:**
```
Sample        | pH  | Color         | Fe (mg/L) | Mn (mg/L)
--------------|-----|---------------|-----------|----------
Raw leachate  | 6.2 | Dark brown    | 85        | 42
After filter  | 6.5 | Light amber   | 8         | 3
Removal %     | -   | 80-90%        | 91%       | 93%
```

**If filtration is poor (<70% metal removal):**

- Flow rate too fast (slow it down)
- Filter media saturated (replace biochar)
- Bypass flow (leak around media, check seals)

**22. Filter media lifespan tracking:**

- **Biochar saturation:** Typically 3-6 months
  - **Signs:** Outlet Fe/Mn concentrations rise back toward inlet levels
  - **Action:** Replace biochar layer
  - **Regeneration option:** Rinse biochar with acid (vinegar or citric acid), then rinse with water, reuse (50-70% recovery)

- **Sand clogging:** 6-12 months
  - **Signs:** Flow rate decreases significantly
  - **Action:** Remove top 5cm, replace with fresh sand

**23. Seasonal adjustments:**

**Winter (low flow or frozen):**

- Drainage may stop (frozen surface)
- Insulate filter column (wrap with straw, foam) to prevent freezing
- Or: Move filter indoors, batch-process when leachate thaws

**Spring (snowmelt, heavy flow):**

- Expect surge in leachate (snowmelt + spring rain)
- May need larger collection bucket or more frequent emptying
- Monitor filter flow rate (may need to slow valve to handle volume)

**Summer (dry):**

- Leachate volume drops
- May be <0.5 L/day or zero
- Less filtration needed (good time to regenerate media)

**Fall (rain returns):**

- Flow increases again
- Check filter before wet season (replace media if saturated)

## Expected Results

**Drainage and filtration system characteristics:**

- **Leachate flow:** 0.5-2 L/day average (varies seasonally)
- **pH (raw):** 5.5-7.5
- **Fe concentration (raw):** 50-200 mg/L (first 3 months), 10-50 mg/L (after 6 months)
- **Mn concentration (raw):** 20-100 mg/L (first 3 months), 5-20 mg/L (after 6 months)
- **Filter performance:** 85-95% Fe/Mn removal
- **Outlet discharge (filtered):** <5-10 mg/L Fe, <2-5 mg/L Mn (safe for soil discharge)

**Quality indicators:**
✅ **Steady, slow drainage** (not flooding, not completely dry)
✅ **Neutral to slightly acidic pH** (6-7.5 range)
✅ **Clear to light amber outlet water** (dark brown inlet → much lighter outlet)
✅ **No foul odors** (earthy, mild smell)
✅ **Effective metal removal** (>80% reduction measured)
✅ **Sustainable discharge** (infiltration bed doesn't flood or clog)

## Troubleshooting

**"No leachate is coming out (drainage has stopped)"**

- **System too dry:** Add 20-30L water to top, check again in 24 hours
- **Drainage pipe clogged:** Remove pipe, check for blockage (roots, sediment), clear
- **Moraine layer compacted:** May need to install additional drainage (second outlet)
- **Frozen (winter):** Wait for thaw, or add insulation

**"Too much leachate (system is waterlogged)"**

- **Excessive moisture input:** Reduce watering, check for roof runoff entering system
- **Poor drainage capacity:** Install second drainage outlet, increase pipe diameter
- **Compost too compacted:** Aerate top layers, add bulking agents

**"Leachate has foul smell (rotten eggs)"**

- **Anaerobic throughout:** Increase system aeration (vents, add coarse material to compost)
- **Sulfate reduction:** Common in very wet, low-O₂ zones (not harmful but indicates imbalance)
- **Action:** Improve drainage, reduce moisture, aerate

**"Filter outlet water is still very dark (not filtering color)"**

- **High DOC (dissolved organic carbon):** Normal in first 3-6 months (system is young)
- **Biochar may not remove all color:** Focus on metal removal (more critical)
- **If persistent and problematic:** Add activated carbon layer to filter (more expensive, higher adsorption)

**"Filter flow rate is very slow (taking days to process daily leachate)"**

- **Biochar is fine powder:** Creates hydraulic resistance (use coarser biochar next time)
- **Sand layer clogged:** Remove and replace top sand
- **Filter column too small:** Increase diameter (more flow area) or add second column in parallel

**"Metal concentrations in outlet are not dropping (filter not working)"**

- **Flow too fast:** Slow down (target <2-5 L/hour through filter)
- **Biochar already saturated:** Replace with fresh biochar
- **Bypass flow:** Check for leaks around media (water flowing through gaps, not through biochar)
- **Wrong biochar type:** Some biochars (very low surface area) adsorb poorly - use high-quality biochar

**"Filter media is washing out into outlet"**

- **Bottom screen inadequate:** Use finer mesh or double-layer screen
- **Flow too turbulent:** Add flow diffuser at inlet (spreads water gently)
- **Media too fine:** Use coarser biochar and sand

**"pH is dropping (becoming acidic) over time"**

- **Organic acids accumulating:** Normal in early composting
- **Moraine buffer exhausted:** Check drainage layer, may need to refresh moraine (annually)
- **Add alkalinity:** Wood ash to compost (200-500g) raises pH

## Connection to Next Steps

**Step 22 outputs (monitored drainage + filtration) enable:**

**→ Step 24 (Advanced Filtration Monitoring):**

- Baseline data from initial monitoring informs optimization
- Metal concentration trends show electrode behavior

**→ Step 25 (Electrical Wiring and EcoFlow Connection):**
