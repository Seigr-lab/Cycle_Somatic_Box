# Step 05: Collect Forest Humus

## Objective

Harvest 8-12kg of iron-rich forest humus for creating enhanced biochar for a high-output system. This local material will transform ordinary wood biochar into highly conductive, iron-doped biochar without any external additives.

**Scale for high-output system:** This step scales quantities for a 2m³ unit with 24 electrodes targeting 200-400W output. If building multiple units, multiply quantities by number of units.

## Why This Matters

Forest humus at the Seigr Hub location contains naturally high concentrations of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) - documented across all NGU datasets. When pyrolyzed (heated in low-oxygen environment), these minerals become embedded in the biochar matrix, creating 2-3× higher electrical conductivity compared to plain wood biochar.

**Performance impact:**

- Standard wood biochar: 50-100 µS/cm conductivity
- Fe-humus biochar: 120-300 µS/cm conductivity  
- MFC current density: +40-60% improvement
- System total output contribution: +20-40W per 2m³ unit (vs +3-5W for small 1m³ system)
- High electrode density (24 vs 6) multiplies this benefit across entire array

## What is Forest Humus (Scientifically)

**Humus = The dark, decomposed organic layer of forest soil**

### **Formation Process:**

1. **Fresh litter falls** (pine needles, leaves, twigs)
2. **Fungi begin decomposition** (break down cellulose)
3. **Bacteria continue breakdown** (release nutrients)
4. **Acids dissolve minerals** from underlying rock/soil
5. **Iron and manganese accumulate** in organic matrix
6. **Dark, crumbly humus forms** (final stage)

This process takes **3-10 years**. The longer the decomposition, the darker and more mineral-rich the humus.

### **Why It's Fe-Rich Here:**

**Granitic bedrock weathering:**

- Granite contains biotite mica (Fe-bearing mineral)
- Acidic decomposition (pH 4-5) dissolves Fe from rock
- Fe ions bind to organic molecules (complexation)
- Concentrated in humus layer over centuries

**Visual evidence:**

- Very dark brown to black color (Fe-organic complexes)
- Rust-orange stains on stones beneath (Fe oxidation)
- Slight magnetic attraction when charred (metallic Fe)

## Materials Needed

### **Collection Tools:**

- **Garden trowel or small hand shovel** - For careful removal
- **Sturdy rake** - To clear fresh needle layer
- **5-gallon bucket** or large bag - Clean, dry container
- **Work gloves** - Protect hands from soil
- **Kneeling pad** - Comfort during collection (optional)

### **Testing Tools:**

- **Strong magnet** - Test for Fe content
- **White paper** - Check color/purity
- **Plastic bag** - For magnet test sample

### **Documentation:**

- **Camera** - Photo each collection site
- **Notebook** - Record locations and observations
- **GPS device** - Mark coordinates for future reference

## Site Selection (From Step 02)

Review your mapped humus zones and select the best:

**High priority criteria:**

- **Humus depth >8cm** (thick enough to harvest without damage)
- **Very dark color** (high Fe content)
- **Dense canopy** (active decomposition)
- **Easy access** (<50m walk from cabin)

**Ideal forest type:**

- Mature spruce (Picea abies) forest - Best Fe accumulation
- Mixed pine-spruce - Good Fe, easier collection
- Avoid: Birch forest - Lower Fe, faster decomposition

**What to avoid:**

- <100m from roads (vehicle emissions, lead contamination)
- Near old buildings (lead paint residue in soil)
- Previously disturbed ground (construction, logging)
- Waterlogged areas (different chemistry, anaerobic)

## Collection Protocol

### **Step 1: Prepare Collection Area (10 minutes)**

1. **Clear a 2m × 2m work area:**
   - Remove sticks, branches, large debris
   - Note the location (stake or GPS mark)
   - Take "before" photo showing humus depth

2. **Create sorting space:**
   - Lay clean tarp or cloth nearby
   - Set up bucket/bag for collection
   - Have tools within reach

### **Step 2: Remove Fresh Litter Layer (5 minutes)**

**What you're removing:**

- Top layer of fresh needles (light brown, still recognizable)
- Partially decomposed needles (tan, soft but intact)
- Small twigs and bark pieces

**Technique:**

- Use rake or gloved hands
- Gently pull back (don't dig)
- Set aside in pile (will be replaced after)
- Stop when you reach dark, crumbly layer

**You've reached humus when:**

- Color changes to dark brown/black
- Texture is fine and crumbly (like coffee grounds)
- Individual needles no longer visible
- Earthy smell intensifies

### **Step 3: Harvest Humus Layer (20-30 minutes)**

**How much to take:**

- **Maximum 50% of humus depth** in any spot
- If humus is 10cm deep → take top 5cm only
- Leave bottom half for ecosystem regeneration

**For high-output system (8-12kg target):**

- Collect from 3-4 separate 2m × 2m areas (rotate sites)
- Take 2-3kg from each site (stays within 50% depth limit)
- Spread impact across forest rather than concentrated harvest

**Technique:**

1. **Gentle scooping:**
   - Use trowel at shallow angle (don't dig straight down)
   - Scrape top portion of humus layer
   - Work across the 2m × 2m area evenly
   - Like shaving, not digging

2. **Avoid mixing with mineral soil:**
   - Humus = dark, light, crumbly
   - Mineral soil = lighter color, heavier, gritty
   - If you hit tan/gray layer → stop, you've gone too deep
   - Mineral soil dilutes Fe concentration

3. **Remove debris:**
   - Pick out roots (white/brown strands)
   - Remove bark pieces
   - Remove pine cones
   - Goal: Pure dark humus only

4. **Fill container:**
   - Loosely packed (don't compress)
   - From each 2m × 2m site: 8-12 liters → dries to ~2-3kg
   - Collect from 3-4 sites total
   - Combined yield: 30-45 liters wet → 8-12kg dry

**Signs you're doing it correctly:**

- Humus has uniform dark color
- Crumbly texture throughout
- No chunks larger than 1cm
- Slightly damp but not wet
- Earthy smell (not sour or moldy)

### **Step 4: Quality Check (5 minutes)**

**Visual inspection:**

1. **Color test:**
   - Spread handful on white paper
   - Should be very dark brown to black
   - Red-brown tint OK (oxidized Fe)
   - Tan or light brown = too much mineral soil mixed in

2. **Texture test:**
   - Crumbles easily between fingers
   - No large chunks or lumps
   - Not sticky or clay-like
   - Fine and uniform

3. **Purity test:**
   - <10% visible roots/twigs = good
   - <5% = excellent
   - Pick out obvious debris

**Magnetic test (confirms Fe content):**

1. Take 2 tablespoons of humus
2. Spread thinly in aluminum foil
3. Dry completely (oven at 100°C for 2 hours, or sun-dry for 2 days)
4. Place dried sample in metal can
5. Heat over campfire or stove until smoking stops (simple char)
6. Cool completely
7. Bring strong magnet close to charred material
8. **Result:** Should see particles visibly attracted to magnet

**Interpretation:**

- Strong attraction (particles jump to magnet) = Excellent Fe content
- Moderate attraction (particles move slightly) = Good Fe content
- Weak attraction (barely noticeable) = Low Fe, still usable
- No attraction = Not from good humus zone, try different location

### **Step 5: Restore Site (10 minutes)**

**Critical for Seigr philosophy: Leave no trace, support regeneration**

1. **Replace litter layer:**
   - Spread removed needles back over collection area
   - Match original thickness approximately
   - Cover exposed humus completely

2. **Add fresh material:**
   - Scatter extra needles from nearby
   - Place small branches for future decomposition
   - Ensures continued humus formation

3. **Mark site:**
   - Small stake or rock pile (low-profile)
   - Note in your map: "Harvested [date], rest until [date+3 years]"
   - Allows tracking of recovery

4. **Document:**
   - "After" photo showing restored appearance
   - GPS coordinates
   - Estimated volume collected

**Why this matters:**

- Humus layer takes 5-10 years to fully regenerate
- We took <50% depth = 2-3 year recovery
- Proper restoration prevents erosion
- Maintains forest health and biodiversity

## Post-Collection Processing

### **Initial Cleaning (Same Day)**

1. **Spread for inspection:**
   - Pour collected humus onto clean tarp
   - Spread in thin layer (2-3cm deep)
   - Look for contamination

2. **Final debris removal:**
   - Pick out any missed roots, twigs, cones
   - Remove any stones (non-organic)
   - Check for insect presence (beetles, etc. - release them)

3. **Break up clumps:**
   - Gently crumble any lumps
   - Should pass through 1cm screen
   - Don't grind into dust (too fine)

### **Drying Process (3-7 Days)**

**Why drying matters:**

- Moist humus can mold during storage
- Weight is mostly water (will lose 40-60%)
- Dry material easier to handle for pyrolysis

**Method 1: Sun drying (preferred)**

1. **Setup:**
   - Spread humus in thin layer (1-2cm) on tarp
   - Place in sunny, protected location
   - Raise off ground if possible (air circulation)

2. **Process:**
   - Stir twice daily (morning and evening)
   - Bring inside if rain threatens
   - Check for complete dryness

3. **Testing dryness:**
   - Squeeze handful tightly
   - Should crumble apart, not clump
   - No moisture feel on skin
   - Slightly dusty texture

**Method 2: Low-temp oven drying**

1. Spread on baking sheets (thin layer)
2. Set oven to 90-100°C (no hotter - preserves organics)
3. Dry for 4-6 hours, stirring every hour
4. Cool completely before storing

**Expected weight:**

- Wet collection per site: 8-12 liters (4-6kg)
- After drying per site: 2-3kg
- Total from 3-4 sites: 8-12kg dry
- This is normal (60% water loss)

### **Storage Until Use**

**Container:**

- Sealed plastic bucket or bag
- Airtight prevents moisture re-absorption
- Keep dry and cool

**Location:**

- Indoor storage (shed, garage)
- Away from direct sunlight
- Dry environment
- Protected from rodents

**Duration:**

- Can store 6-12 months easily
- Check monthly for moisture (re-dry if needed)
- Use within 1 year for best results

**Labeling:**

```
SEIGR HUB - Forest Humus for Biochar
Collection date: [date]
Location: [GPS or description]
Weight dry: [kg]
Magnetic test: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
Notes: [color, quality observations]
```

## Expected Results

From complete collection (3-4 sites):

**Volume collected:**

- Fresh: 30-45 liters (from all sites)
- Dry: 12-20 liters (from all sites)
- Weight: 8-12kg dry

**This provides enough for:**

- 25-35L Fe-humus biochar (at 30% humus ratio in blend)
- Enough for one 2m³ high-output unit (24 electrodes)
- If building multiple units, repeat collection process for each unit

**Quality indicators:**

✅ **Very dark color** - High Fe content confirmed  
✅ **Magnetic attraction** - Metallic Fe present  
✅ **Fine, crumbly texture** - Pure humus, no mineral soil  
✅ **Earthy smell** - Active decomposition, healthy  
✅ **Low debris** - Clean collection technique  

## Multiple Collection Strategy

**If you need more material:**

**Rotate collection sites:**

- Collect from Zone A in Year 1
- Collect from Zone B in Year 2
- Collect from Zone C in Year 3
- Zone A has recovered by Year 4

**This approach:**

- Maintains ecosystem health
- Ensures sustainable harvesting
- Provides consistent quality
- Demonstrates Seigr regenerative principles

## Next Step

**Step 06: Gather Stream Minerals** - Now we'll collect manganese nodules and sand for electrode enhancement.

Alternatively, if your site has no streams:
**Skip to Step 07: Test Water Sources** - Evaluate groundwater for the system.

## Troubleshooting

**"The humus layer is only 3-4cm thick everywhere"**

- Collect from larger area (4m × 4m instead of 2m × 2m)
- Take only top 1-2cm (25-33% of depth)
- Supplement with regular biochar if needed
- Still provides some Fe enhancement

**"Magnetic test shows weak attraction"**

- Still usable, just lower Fe concentration
- Try different collection zone
- Mix 50/50 with better humus if you find some
- System still works, slightly less efficient

**"Humus is very wet and heavy"**

- Normal in spring or after rain
- Extend drying time (may take 7-14 days)
- Ensure good air circulation
- Can still use, just takes longer to dry

**"I accidentally collected too deep and got mineral soil"**

- Screen through 5mm mesh (humus falls through, stones stay)
- Wash gently with water, let humus settle, pour off water
- Re-dry completely
- Reduces Fe concentration but still usable

**"Storage container developed mold"**

- Material wasn't fully dry
- Spread and re-dry immediately
- Use lower temp (80°C) for longer time
- Ensure airtight storage after re-drying

## Safety & Ecology Notes

**Personal safety:**

- Wear gloves (soil microbes, sharp objects)
- Wash hands thoroughly after
- Avoid face touching during collection
- Clean tools before storing

**Ecological care:**

- Never harvest entire humus layer (max 50% depth)
- Restore litter layer completely
- Mark and track collection sites
- Allow 3+ years recovery before re-harvesting
- Rotate between multiple sites

**Quality of forest afterward:**

- Should look undisturbed from 5m away
- Ground cover returns within weeks
- Humus regenerates in 2-3 years
- No erosion or visible damage

This is **regenerative harvesting** - taking sustainably while supporting ecosystem health. It's the Seigr way.
