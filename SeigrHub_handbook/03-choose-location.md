# Step 03: Choose Location

## Objective

Select the optimal placement for your Cycle Somatic Box system based on the site assessment data from Step 02. This decision affects performance, maintenance access, and integration with local geology.

## Why This Matters

The system's location determines:

- **Access to groundwater** - Shorter distance = easier moisture management
- **Drainage efficiency** - Proper slope prevents waterlogging
- **Temperature stability** - Shading affects microbial activity
- **Material transport** - Distance from humus/mineral sources
- **Long-term maintenance** - Year-round accessibility

At the Seigr Hub, we have the advantage of mineral-rich groundwater (NGU dataset 299300.01) and Fe-rich forest humus within 50m. Your location choice should optimize access to these geological resources.

## Site Selection Criteria

### **1. Proximity to Water Source (Critical)**

**Groundwater access:**

- **Ideal:** <20m from well, spring, or shallow water table
- **Acceptable:** 20-50m (manageable with hose)
- **Problematic:** >50m (water transport becomes labor-intensive)

**Why groundwater matters here:**
NGU dataset 299300.01 shows our groundwater contains dissolved Ca, Mg, K, Na - natural electrolytes that boost MFC performance by 20-30% compared to rainwater. Being close to the source means you can easily maintain optimal moisture levels.

**Test your distance:**

- Walk from proposed site to water source
- Time the walk (should be <2 minutes)
- Consider hose routing (can it reach without kinking?)
- Check winter access (ice, snow blockage?)

### **2. Drainage Assessment (Non-Negotiable)**

**Slope requirements:**

- **Optimal:** 2-5° gentle slope
- **Acceptable:** <2° with gravel base enhancement
- **Avoid:** >5° (erosion risk, uneven settling)
- **Never:** Flat depression where water pools

**Drainage test (from Step 02):**

- Dig 30cm test hole at proposed site
- Fill with water completely
- Time how long to drain

**Results interpretation:**

- 2-4 hours = Sandy soil, excellent drainage
- 4-8 hours = Mixed soil, good drainage  
- 8-12 hours = Some clay, acceptable with gravel layer
- >12 hours = Too much clay, choose different location

**Why critical:**
Waterlogged systems fail. Excess water prevents oxygen reaching cathodes, drowns aerobic microbes, and creates anaerobic conditions (smelly, non-productive). Our moraine buffer layer (NGU datasets 225000.02, 351700.24) helps with drainage, but can't overcome fundamentally poor site selection.

### **3. Sun Exposure Pattern**

**Ideal exposure:**

- Morning sun (6am-10am): Beneficial (warms system after cold night)
- Midday sun (10am-2pm): Problematic (overheating risk)
- Afternoon sun (2pm-6pm): Avoid (peak heat stress)
- Shade after 2pm: Optimal

**Temperature impacts:**

- **Too much sun:** System overheats >35°C, microbes slow down
- **Too much shade:** System stays cool <15°C, slower decomposition
- **Optimal:** Partial shade, 18-28°C range maintained

**Test sun exposure:**

1. Visit proposed site at 9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm
2. Note sun/shade at each time
3. Check surrounding trees (will they grow and change pattern?)
4. Consider seasonal changes (deciduous trees lose leaves in winter)

**Seigr Hub advantage:**
Our spruce/pine canopy provides consistent year-round shade. Coniferous forest maintains stable understory temperatures - perfect for microbial activity.

### **4. Distance to Resource Zones**

**From your Step 02 map, measure distances to:**

**Humus collection zones:**

- Ideal: <50m
- Acceptable: 50-100m
- Problematic: >100m (heavy, multiple trips needed)
- Collected volume: ~10L per batch (wheelbarrow transport)

**Stream/mineral sources:**

- Ideal: <200m
- Acceptable: 200-500m  
- Manageable: >500m (one-time collection, smaller volume)
- Collected volume: ~2L nodules + 20L moraine (doable in backpack/buckets)

**Build site accessibility:**

- Can reach with wheelbarrow year-round?
- Path clear of major obstacles (large rocks, steep sections)?
- Snow-free or easily cleared in winter?

**Optimization:**
If you can't minimize all distances, prioritize: Water source > Humus zones > Stream minerals. Water is used continuously, humus 2-3 times during build, minerals once.

### **5. Elevation and Frost Pockets**

**Frost pocket identification:**

- Low-lying areas where cold air settles
- Last place to thaw in spring
- First place to freeze in fall
- Often near streams or valley bottoms

**How to identify:**

1. Look for topographic depressions (even subtle ones)
2. Check in early morning spring (frost pattern visible)
3. Note vegetation (frost-sensitive plants absent in pockets)
4. Ask locals about "cold spots" on property

**Why avoid:**

- Extended freezing damages electrodes
- Late spring thaw = delayed spring activation
- Increased insulation needs (more materials, more work)

**Best choice:**

- Mid-slope position (not hilltop, not valley bottom)
- Slight elevation above surrounding area (+1-2m is enough)
- Good air drainage (cold air flows away downslope)

**Seigr Hub terrain:**
Our cabin sits on granitic ridge - naturally good air drainage. Most positions work, but avoid the lowest areas near stream banks.

### **6. Wind Exposure**

**Wind effects:**

- **Strong wind:** Dries out system faster, cools in winter
- **No wind:** Poor air circulation, potential odor issues
- **Moderate wind:** Optimal (air exchange without excessive drying)

**Test wind patterns:**

- Observe during typical weather (not just calm days)
- Note prevailing wind direction (usually southwest in Norway)
- Check for wind tunnels (between buildings, through gaps)
- Consider winter storm winds (stronger, different direction)

**Protection strategies:**

- Natural: Trees, shrubs, terrain features
- Built: Walls, windbreaks (3m distance minimum)
- Avoid: Complete wind block (need some air movement)

**Ideal:**
Light breeze reaches site, but not exposed to full force of storms.

### **7. Access and Working Space**

**Construction phase needs:**

- 3m clearance on all sides (material staging, working room)
- Level area for tool setup
- Ability to bring in wheelbarrow loads
- Space for temporary material storage (tarps, piles)

**Operation phase needs:**

- Comfortable approach for feeding (daily/weekly)
- Can reach all sides for inspection
- Room for harvest/output removal
- Sensor checking without obstacles

**Year-round access:**

- Not blocked by seasonal snow drifts
- Path remains clear (or easily cleared)
- Safe footing in winter (not ice-prone slope)
- Visible from cabin (monitoring)

**Working comfort:**

- Enough space you don't feel cramped
- Pleasant environment (nice view, forest sounds)
- Protected from worst weather
- Ergonomic access (not bending/reaching awkwardly)

### **8. Environmental Considerations**

**Water body setbacks:**

- Minimum 30m from streams, lakes, ponds
- Prevents any leachate runoff contamination
- Even with heavy metal filter, maintain buffer

**Property boundaries:**
>
- >10m from neighboring properties (courtesy)
- Consider sight lines if aesthetics matter
- Comply with any local regulations

**Wildlife corridors:**

- Avoid game trails (moose, deer disturbance)
- Not in bird nesting areas (especially raptors)
- Away from den sites (badger, fox)

**Ecological sensitivity:**

- Not on rare plant populations
- Avoid wetland edges (high biodiversity zones)
- Preserve interesting ecological features

**Seigr philosophy:**
Choose location that minimizes ecosystem disruption. The system should integrate with forest ecology, not dominate it.

## Decision Matrix

**Score each potential location (1-5 points per criterion):**

| Criterion | Weight | Site A | Site B | Site C |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Water distance (<20m = 5pts) | 3× | | | |
| Drainage (4-8hr = 5pts) | 3× | | | |
| Sun pattern (shade PM = 5pts) | 2× | | | |
| Humus distance (<50m = 5pts) | 2× | | | |
| Frost avoidance (no pocket = 5pts) | 2× | | | |
| Wind protection (moderate = 5pts) | 1× | | | |
| Access ease (year-round = 5pts) | 2× | | | |
| Environmental (30m+ water = 5pts) | 2× | | | |

**Multiply each score by weight, sum totals.**

**Example:**
Site A: Water 15pts (5×3) + Drainage 15pts + Sun 8pts (4×2) + Humus 10pts + Frost 10pts + Wind 4pts + Access 10pts + Environment 10pts = **82 points**

**Winning site = highest total**

## Final Verification

**Before committing, spend time at chosen location:**

**Morning visit (7-9am):**

- Check dew pattern (indicates drainage)
- Note sun exposure
- Listen to bird activity (indicator of ecology)
- Feel morning temperature

**Midday visit (11am-1pm):**

- Maximum sun exposure check
- Warmest temperature of day
- Assess shade coverage

**Evening visit (5-7pm):**

- Afternoon shade confirmation
- Temperature drop rate
- Accessibility in changing light

**Weather variation:**

- Visit after rain (check pooling)
- Visit during wind (check exposure)
- Visit in cold morning (frost patterns)

**The "gut check":**

- Do you feel good about working here?
- Is it pleasant to visit?
- Can you see yourself maintaining this long-term?
- Does it feel right?

## Marking and Documentation

**Once decided:**

1. **Mark the center point:**
   - Wooden stake or large stone
   - GPS coordinates recorded
   - Distance measurements from landmarks

2. **Mark the perimeter:**
   - 1m radius from center (2m diameter system)
   - 2m radius for working space
   - Spray paint, string, or stakes

3. **Document the choice:**
   - Photos from 4 cardinal directions
   - Wide shot showing context
   - Close-up of ground surface
   - Topographic relationship to surroundings

## Site Preparation Preview

**What comes next (Step 04):**

- Clear vegetation (minimal disturbance)
- Level the ground (within 2°)
- Mark foundation corners
- Begin material staging

**Don't do yet:**

- Don't dig foundation (Step 08)
- Don't clear large area (Step 04 will specify)
- Don't move materials here (staging comes later)

## Quality Checks

After completing this step, you should have:

✅ **One location clearly selected** with documented reasoning  
✅ **GPS coordinates recorded** with backup landmark references  
✅ **Site marked physically** with center and perimeter visible  
✅ **Photo documentation** from multiple angles and times  
✅ **Decision matrix completed** showing why this location won  
✅ **Drainage verified** with actual test results  
✅ **Access confirmed** for all seasons  

## Next Step

**Step 04: Design Your System** - Now that location is locked in, we'll determine exact dimensions, electrode configuration, and electrical layout specific to your needs.

## Troubleshooting

**"No location scores high on all criteria"**

- Prioritize: Water > Drainage > Sun > Access
- Can improve some factors (add shade structure, build path)
- Can't fix: Poor drainage, frost pocket (must choose different spot)

**"Two locations tie in scoring"**

- Spend more time at each (hour-long observation)
- Consider future factors (tree growth, property changes)
- Choose the one that "feels" better (intuition matters)

**"Perfect location is on steep slope"**

- Can terrace into hillside (more work, stable result)
- Need retaining wall on downhill side
- Excellent drainage is guaranteed
- See Step 08 for slope foundation techniques

**"Nearest water is >50m away"**

- Consider intermediate collection point (tank at 25m)
- Gravity-feed from tank to system (passive)
- Or commit to hose routing (bury to prevent freezing)
- Rainwater collection as backup

**"Site has partial shade but not ideal pattern"**

- Can improve with added shade cloth (removable)
- Monitor first year, add protection if needed
- Microbes adapt to temperature patterns over time

## Additional Considerations

### **Permitting and Regulations**

**Check if required:**

- Municipal composting regulations (usually exempt for small household systems)
- Setback requirements (rare for composters but verify)
- Building codes (if permanent structure >10m²)

**For Seigr Hub:**

- Rural location = minimal regulations
- Under 10m² = typically no permit
- Composting = encouraged activity
- Document regardless (good practice)

### **Future Expansion**

**Consider:**

- Could you add second system nearby? (2-3m spacing)
- Room for material processing area? (biochar production)
- Space for finished compost storage?
- Experimental variations (testing improvements)?

**Don't overplan:**

- Build one system first, learn from it
- Future site needs may differ from predictions
- Flexibility matters more than rigid long-term plan

### **Aesthetic Integration**

**Make it look intentional:**

- Natural materials blend with forest
- Low profile (not visible from cabin if preferred)
- Or feature it (educational/demonstration aspect)
- Screened by vegetation (natural or planted)

**Seigr approach:**
Functional beauty - it should look like it belongs, like it grew there naturally, integrated with the forest ecosystem.
