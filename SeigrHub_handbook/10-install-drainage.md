# Step 10: Install Drainage System

## Objective

Create a multi-layer drainage system for a 2m³ high-output unit that manages moisture flow, prevents waterlogging, protects water quality, and enables safe leachate handling.

**Scale for high-output system:** This step installs drainage for one 2m³ unit (1.6m × 1.6m footprint = 2.56m² vs 1.44m² for 1m³). Material quantities scaled accordingly.

## Why This Matters

**Drainage controls the system's water balance:**

- **Prevents waterlogging** - Excess water creates anaerobic zones (low power, bad smell)
- **Maintains optimal moisture** - 50-70% by weight for best microbial activity
- **Removes dissolved waste** - Organic acids, excess nutrients flush out
- **Protects groundwater** - Filtered leachate prevents contamination
- **Enables monitoring** - Leachate analysis reveals system health

**Without proper drainage:**

- Anaerobic decomposition (methane production, not electron production)
- Sulfide buildup (rotten egg smell, cathode poisoning)
- Electrode flooding (short circuits, corrosion)
- System failure in 6-12 months

**Norwegian climate creates drainage challenges:**

- High rainfall (800-1200mm/year) - excess water input
- Spring snowmelt - large moisture pulse
- Freeze-thaw cycles - drainage pathways can clog
- Forest humus (low permeability) - slow natural drainage

**Our system design overcomes these:**

- Multi-layer filtration (prevents clogging)
- Gravity drainage (no pumps, no power needed)
- Heavy metal capture (biochar adsorption)
- pH neutralization (moraine buffering)

## Drainage System Layers (Bottom to Top)

### **Layer 1: Foundation Gravel (Already Installed in Step 08)**

- 5-10cm depth, 10-20mm stones
- Function: Structural drainage, prevents moisture wicking up from ground
- Already in place on foundation deck

### **Layer 2: Collection Gravel (To Be Installed)**

- 5-10cm depth, 10-20mm clean stones
- Function: Collects leachate from above, channels to outlet

### **Layer 3: Heavy Metal Filter Biochar (To Be Installed)**

- 3-5cm depth, high-temperature biochar (800-900°C)
- Function: Adsorbs Pb, Cd, Hg, other heavy metals from leachate

### **Layer 4: Moraine pH Buffer (To Be Installed)**

- 5-7cm depth, 2-10mm glacial moraine (collected in Step 06)
- Function: Neutralizes organic acids, maintains pH 6.5-7.5

### **Layer 5: Transition Fabric (To Be Installed)**

- Landscape fabric or coconut coir mat
- Function: Prevents fine biochar particles from migrating down, allows water flow

**Total drainage system thickness:** 18-32cm (plus foundation gravel below)

## Materials Needed

**From previous steps:**

- Moraine pH buffer: 100-150L moraine + 100L gravel (collected in Step 06)
- Foundation gravel: Already installed (Step 08)

**To be prepared:**

- Heavy metal filter biochar: 15-20L (high-temp, clean biochar)
  - From Step 11 (wood biochar production)
  - Must be pyrolyzed at 800-900°C (higher than electrode biochar)
  - Or purchased activated carbon (expensive, ~€50/20L)

**To be sourced:**

- Collection gravel: 20-30L clean stone (10-20mm diameter)
  - From same source as foundation gravel
  - Or use foundation gravel overflow

- Transition fabric: 1-2m² landscape fabric or burlap
  - Breathable but blocks fine particles
  - Available at garden centers (€5-15)

**For leachate drainage:**

- Drainage pipe: 2-3m of 2-3cm diameter perforated pipe (PVC or flexible corrugated)
  - Or skip pipe and use gravel-only drainage (simpler, zero cost)
- Collection container: 10-20L bucket or tank (food-grade plastic)
  - For leachate monitoring and optional use

**Tools needed:**

- Shovel or scoop (for spreading layers)
- Bucket (for measuring volumes)
- Scissors or knife (for cutting fabric)
- Level (to check layer flatness)

## Understanding Leachate

**What is leachate?**

- Water that has percolated through composting material
- Contains dissolved organic compounds, nutrients, minerals
- Color: Dark brown to black (humic substances)
- Odor: Earthy (if aerobic) or sulfurous (if anaerobic - indicates problem)

**Leachate composition (expected):**

**Nutrients:**

- Nitrogen (N): 200-800 mg/L (mostly as ammonium NH₄⁺)
- Phosphorus (P): 20-100 mg/L (as phosphate PO₄³⁻)
- Potassium (K): 500-1500 mg/L (highly soluble)

**Organic content:**

- COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand): 5,000-20,000 mg/L (very high)
- BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand): 3,000-15,000 mg/L
- Indicates rich organic content (not safe to discharge untreated)

**pH:**

- Initial (first weeks): 5.0-6.0 (acidic from organic acid production)
- Mature (after 2-3 months): 6.5-7.5 (neutralized by moraine buffer)

**Heavy metals (before filtration):**

- Can leach from food waste (Cd from batteries in fish, Pb from old paint on vegetable peels)
- Filter biochar captures these before leachate exits

**After filtration (expected):**

- pH: 6.5-7.5
- Heavy metals: <0.01 mg/L (safe levels)
- Nutrients: Still high (but no longer contains toxins)
- COD/BOD: Reduced 30-50% by biochar adsorption

## Installation Process

### **Phase 1: Prepare Base (Foundation Gravel)**

**1. Verify foundation gravel is level:**

- Use level across drainage gravel surface installed in Step 08
- Should be flat within ±1cm
- If uneven, add gravel to low spots, rake smooth

**2. Mark leachate outlet location:**

- Choose one corner or center of one wall
- This is where drainage pipe will exit (if using pipe)
- Should be lowest point of foundation (gravity drainage)

### **Phase 2: Install Collection Gravel Layer**

**3. Add collection gravel:**

- Spread 20-30L of 10-20mm clean stone
- Depth: 5-10cm across entire floor (1.6m × 1.6m = 2.56m² = 128-256L total needed)
- Use 150-180L clean gravel for this layer
- Rake smooth and level
- This layer channels leachate to outlet

**4. Install drainage pipe (optional but recommended):**

- Lay perforated pipe across gravel bed (if using)
- Route from center of floor to outlet location
- Pipe holes face down (draw water from gravel)
- Pipe exit extends through wall (drill hole in wall base)
- Cover pipe with extra gravel (prevents clogging)

**If skipping pipe:**

- Leachate will seep through gravel and drip from foundation edge
- Less control, but simpler
- Still functional (gravity does the work)

### **Phase 3: Heavy Metal Filter Biochar Layer**

**5. Prepare filter biochar:**

- Use high-temp biochar from Step 11 (800-900°C pyrolysis)
- Crush to 2-10mm particle size (not powder, not chunks)
- Rinse with clean water until rinse water runs clear (removes ash, fine dust)
- Dry completely (spread on tarp in sun, 1-2 days)

**6. Spread filter biochar:**

- Pour 15-20L biochar evenly over collection gravel
- Depth: 3-5cm across floor
- Rake smooth (but don't compact heavily - air pockets are okay)

**Why this layer works:**

- Biochar's porous structure (high surface area: 200-400 m²/g)
- Negatively charged surface attracts metal cations (Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, Hg²⁺)
- High-temp biochar has more fixed carbon, less residual tars (better adsorption)

### **Phase 4: Moraine pH Buffer Layer**

**7. Add moraine buffer:**

- Spread 50L glacial moraine (collected in Step 06)
- Depth: 5-7cm across floor
- Particle size: 2-10mm (screened from larger stones, smaller clay)
- Spread evenly, rake smooth

**8. Test pH buffering (optional verification):**

- Pour 500ml water onto moraine layer
- Wait 5 minutes for minerals to dissolve
- Collect drip from bottom (in bucket)
- Test pH (should be 7.0-7.5, neutral to slightly alkaline)
- If acidic (<6.5), moraine may lack calcite - add crushed limestone (garden lime)

**Why this layer works:**

- Ca and Mg in moraine react with organic acids:
  - CaCO₃ + 2H⁺ → Ca²⁺ + H₂O + CO₂
  - MgCO₃ + 2H⁺ → Mg²⁺ + H₂O + CO₂
- Neutralizes acidity, prevents pH drop below 6.5
- Slow-release (lasts 5-7 years before exhausted)

### **Phase 5: Transition Fabric Layer**

**9. Install fabric barrier:**

- Cut landscape fabric or burlap to 1.1m × 1.1m (slightly larger than floor)
- Lay over moraine layer
- Smooth out wrinkles (flat surface)
- Fold excess up walls slightly (2-3cm) to prevent edge bypass

**10. Secure fabric:**

- Staple or tack to inner wall base (if accessible)
- Or weight down edges with a few stones (prevents shifting during biochar loading)

**Purpose:**

- Prevents electrode biochar (fine particles) from migrating down into drainage layers
- Allows water to pass through (breathable fabric)
- Easy to replace if clogged (though shouldn't clog for years)

### **Phase 6: Drainage Outlet Setup**

**11. Route drainage pipe through wall (if using pipe):**

- Drill hole in wall at outlet location (3-4cm diameter)
- Thread pipe through hole
- Seal around pipe with biochar tar or caulk (prevents air gap)
- Pipe extends 10-20cm outside wall

**12. Position collection container:**

- Place bucket/tank under pipe outlet
- Elevate slightly on stones (air circulation beneath)
- Cover with lid (reduces evaporation, keeps debris out)
- Should be easy to remove and empty

**If not using pipe:**

- Place container beneath foundation corner where leachate drips
- Check weekly (may need emptying more often without concentrated drainage)

### **Phase 7: System Testing**

**13. Test drainage flow:**

- Pour 10-20L clean water onto fabric layer (from watering can)
- Observe:
  - Water should soak into fabric within 1-2 minutes (not pool)
  - Should appear in collection container within 5-10 minutes
  - Should be clear to light brown (not dark black yet - no biochar above yet)
- If water pools: Fabric may be too dense, poke holes or use looser weave
- If water doesn't reach container: Check pipe routing, gravel continuity

**14. Monitor initial leachate (after system is loaded with biochar/compost):**

- Expect dark brown color (humic substances)
- Expect pH 5.5-6.5 (will rise to 6.5-7.5 after moraine buffering activates)
- Volume: 2-5L per week (depends on rainfall, food waste moisture)

## Leachate Management

**Three options for collected leachate:**

### **Option 1: Return to System (Recirculation)**

- **How:** Pour leachate back onto compost surface (like watering)
- **Advantages:** 
  - Retains nutrients in system (N, P, K)
  - Increases moisture if system is dry
  - Inoculates fresh compost with beneficial microbes
- **Disadvantages:** 
  - Can over-wet system if rainfall is already high
  - May concentrate salts if done excessively
- **Best for:** Dry periods, initial startup, nutrient conservation

### **Option 2: Dilute and Apply to Garden**

- **How:** Dilute 1:10 (leachate:water), use as liquid fertilizer
- **Advantages:** 
  - High nutrient content (great for plants)
  - Free fertilizer
  - Reduces waste
- **Disadvantages:** 
  - Strong smell (apply in evening, away from living areas)
  - Can burn plants if applied undiluted
  - Attracts pests if applied on surface (dig into soil instead)
- **Best for:** Growing season, vegetable gardens, fruit trees

### **Option 3: Discharge to Soak-Away Pit**

- **How:** Dig shallow pit (50cm deep) 10m from system, fill with gravel, discharge leachate into pit (filters into soil)
- **Advantages:** 
  - No maintenance (automatic disposal)
  - No odor at living area
  - Final biological treatment in soil
- **Disadvantages:** 
  - Needs suitable soil (not bedrock, not clay)
  - May create wet spot (avoid near foundations)
- **Best for:** High leachate volume, remote site, low maintenance preference

**Seigr Hub recommendation:**

- **Summer:** Option 2 (garden fertilizer)
- **Winter:** Option 3 (soak-away) or Option 1 if system needs moisture
- **Startup phase (first 2-3 months):** Monitor leachate chemistry (pH, color, smell) before deciding

## Monitoring Drainage Health

**Weekly inspection:**

- Check leachate volume (should be steady, 2-5L/week)
- Check color (dark brown is normal, black indicates over-wetting, clear indicates very dry system)
- Smell test (earthy is good, sour/rotten indicates anaerobic pockets)

**Monthly testing (optional but valuable):**

- pH of leachate (should stabilize at 6.5-7.5 after first month)
- If pH stays low (<6.0): Moraine buffer may be exhausted or bypassed (add more moraine on top)
- If pH is high (>8.0): Excessive moraine dissolution (reduce moraine contact time, unlikely)

**Annual maintenance:**

- Inspect drainage pipe (if used) for clogs (flush with clean water)
- Check fabric for clogging (unlikely, but can lift corner to inspect)
- Measure leachate nutrient levels (N, P, K) if sending to lab (curiosity, not necessary)

## Quality Checks

After completing this step, you should have:

✅ **Collection gravel installed** (5-10cm, level)  
✅ **Filter biochar layer in place** (3-5cm, rinsed and dry)  
✅ **Moraine buffer layer installed** (5-7cm, pH tested)  
✅ **Fabric barrier laid** (smooth, secured)  
✅ **Drainage outlet functional** (pipe routed or drip collection set up)  
✅ **Water test passed** (flow observed, timing confirmed)  
✅ **Collection container positioned** (ready to receive leachate)  

## Timeline

**Drainage installation:** 3-5 hours

- Layer preparation and spreading: 2-3 hours
- Outlet setup: 1 hour
- Testing: 30 minutes - 1 hour

## Troubleshooting

**"Water pools on fabric, won't drain"**

- Fabric too dense (use looser weave) or clogged with fine particles
- Lift fabric, check moraine layer below (should be free-draining)
- Poke holes in fabric with stick (increase permeability)
- Or replace with coarser burlap or coconut coir mat

**"Leachate is very dark and has strong smell"**

- Indicates anaerobic decomposition (not enough oxygen)
- Increase ventilation in compost zone above (more air holes in walls)
- Reduce moisture input (less watering, cover during heavy rain)
- Check drainage flow (may be clogged, causing waterlogging)

**"Very little leachate production"**

- System may be too dry (check compost moisture, should feel like wrung sponge)
- Normal in winter (low evaporation, high moisture retention)
- Can be good (less nutrient loss, more retention in compost)

**"Leachate pH is still acidic after several weeks"**

- Moraine buffer not engaging (water bypassing layer?)
- Add more moraine, or add crushed limestone (garden lime) to leachate before use
- Test moraine layer separately (pour acid water, see if it neutralizes)

**"Drainage pipe clogs"**

- Rinse pipe with clean water (pour down from top)
- If severe, remove pipe, clear holes with wire, reinstall
- Prevention: Ensure fabric barrier is intact (prevents fine particles from reaching pipe)

**"Leachate contains visible heavy metal contamination (film, color change)"**

- Rare, but possible if food waste source is contaminated
- Increase filter biochar depth (up to 10cm if needed)
- Test leachate with heavy metal test kit (aquarium supply stores)
- Do not use leachate in garden until confirmed safe

**"Can I skip the heavy metal filter layer?"**

- Not recommended if using food waste (unknown contamination sources)
- If only using garden waste (leaves, grass clippings) - lower risk, could skip
- Biochar layer also improves drainage, so functional benefit even if no heavy metals

**"Moraine is not available, what can I substitute?"**

- Crushed limestone or marble (pure calcite - CaCO₃)
- Dolomite gravel (CaMg(CO₃)₂ - has both Ca and Mg)
- Wood ash (high pH, but less long-lasting than minerals)
- Oyster shells crushed (if near coast - pure CaCO₃)

## Important Notes

**Drainage is passive but critical:**

- No moving parts, no electricity
- Relies on gravity, capillary action, material properties
- Once installed, requires minimal intervention
- Failure would be catastrophic (waterlogging kills system)

**Layers work as a system:**

- Gravel: Fast drainage (structural)
- Biochar: Filtration (chemical)
- Moraine: Buffering (chemical)
- Fabric: Separation (physical)
- Each layer depends on the one below

**This connects to NGU geology:**

- Moraine composition (Step 01, NGU 134100.01) determines buffering capacity
- Ca + Mg content makes our moraine ideal for this application
- Heavy metal filter addresses potential (though unlikely at Seigr Hub) contamination
- System is tuned to local water chemistry (Step 07)

**Over-engineering drainage is better than under-engineering:**

- Excess drainage capacity = system stays aerobic, performs well
- Insufficient drainage = anaerobic disaster
- When in doubt, add more gravel, thicker layers

---

**Drainage installed - moisture management secured!**

With a multi-layer filtration and buffering system in place, we can now confidently load the system with biochar and compost knowing that water quality, pH stability, and groundwater protection are engineered in from the foundation up.

Next: **Step 11 - Prepare Wood Biochar** (creating the high-surface-area carbon base that will host our electricity-generating microbes).
