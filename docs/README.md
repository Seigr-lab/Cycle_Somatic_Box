## **Introduction**

The Cycle-Somatic Box is an experimental, multi-stream energy harvesting system designed to achieve **energy independence** for the Seigr Hub, a forest cabin powered by a 4kWh EcoFlow Power Kit. While solar panels provide primary energy during optimal conditions, the Cycle-Somatic Box addresses the critical challenge of **continuous, year-round energy generation** during periods of low sunlight, harsh weather, and seasonal variations.

This advanced system combines **multiple energy harvesting technologies** to extract power from any available natural resources:

- **Stratified Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC)** - generating electricity from organic matter decomposition
- **Thermal Gradient Harvesting** - capturing temperature differentials between soil and ambient air
- **Streaming Potential Collection** - harvesting energy from moisture movement through soil
- **Atmospheric Charge Differential** - collecting ground-to-air electrical potential

**Universal Design Philosophy:** The system is engineered to work with **any forest soil composition** and **any available organic matter**, making it adaptable to unknown or variable environmental conditions while maximizing energy output from whatever natural resources are available.

This repository documents the design, construction, and operation of the enhanced Cycle-Somatic Box for future reference and refinement. While the project may inspire others, its primary purpose is to serve as a practical solution for achieving **sustainable energy independence** at the Seigr Hub.
