# **Cycle-Somatic Box**

## **Introduction**

The Cycle-Somatic Box is a personal, experimental project designed to solve a critical challenge: achieving sustainable, continuous energy generation to support the Seigr Hub, a forest cabin powered by a 4kWh EcoFlow Power Kit. Solar energy, the primary source, often becomes insufficient during extended periods of low sunlight, such as winter or overcast conditions. The Cycle-Somatic Box addresses this gap by harnessing microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology to generate electricity while transforming organic waste into nutrient-rich soil.

This repository documents the design, construction, and operation of the Cycle-Somatic Box for future reference and refinement. While the project may inspire others, its primary purpose is to serve as a practical solution for specific challenges faced at the Seigr Hub.

## **The Problem**

1. **Seasonal Energy Gaps**:
   - Solar panels alone cannot consistently provide sufficient energy during winter or prolonged cloudy weather.
   - The EcoFlow Power Kit at the Seigr Hub requires a dependable backup energy source to ensure year-round operation.

2. **Unutilized Organic Waste**:
   - Organic waste, such as kitchen scraps, forest biomass, and human feces, is abundant but often underutilized.

3. **Sustainability**:
   - Achieving a closed-loop system that addresses energy and waste challenges aligns with the Seigr ethos of environmental responsibility.

## **The Solution: Cycle-Somatic Box**

The Cycle-Somatic Box is a self-contained system that combines microbial fuel cell technology with composting to address these problems.

1. **Continuous Energy Generation**:
   - MFC technology converts microbial activity in organic waste into a consistent trickle of electricity.
   - The power output is stabilized and boosted to recharge the EcoFlow Power Kit.

2. **Waste Regeneration**:
   - Organic waste is converted into nutrient-rich compost for forest regeneration and waste management.

3. **Year-Round Operation**:
   - Insulated and moisture-regulated design ensures functionality even in harsh winter conditions.
