# **Cycle-Somatic Box: Usage Guide**

This guide outlines the step-by-step process for setting up, operating, and maintaining the Cycle-Somatic Box to ensure optimal performance for energy generation and composting.

## **1. Initial Setup**

### **1.1 Preparing the Box**

- Place the Cycle-Somatic Box on a flat, stable surface with access to sunlight if possible.
- Ensure ventilation slats and drainage holes are unobstructed.
- Assemble the electrodes, soil tray, and compost chamber according to the assembly instructions in `INSTALL.md`.

### **1.2 Connecting the Electrical System**

- Securely connect the anode and cathode electrodes to the DC-DC converter using insulated wires.
- Connect the output of the DC-DC converter to your EcoFlow Power Kit or equivalent power storage system.
- Verify all connections using a multimeter to ensure proper continuity and polarity.

### **1.3 Preparing the Compost**

- Add a base layer of coarse organic material (e.g., straw, wood chips) to improve aeration.
- Mix in kitchen scraps, yard waste, or other biodegradable materials.
- Optionally, add bokashi or compost activators to accelerate microbial activity.
- Maintain a moisture level of 50-60% (damp but not soaking).

## **2. Daily Operations**

### **2.1 Compost Management**

- **Aeration**: Gently turn the compost daily to improve oxygen flow and prevent anaerobic zones.
- **Moisture Check**:
  - If too dry: Sprinkle water evenly over the pile.
  - If too wet: Add dry material (e.g., shredded cardboard, sawdust) to absorb excess moisture.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Ensure the compost stays warm (ideally 40–60°C) to maintain microbial activity.

### **2.2 Energy Monitoring**

- Use a multimeter to measure the voltage and current output of the electrodes.
- Check the EcoFlow Power Kit for energy storage levels and ensure stable power delivery.

## **3. Weekly Maintenance**

### **3.1 Inspecting Components**

- Check the condition of the electrodes for wear or damage.
- Inspect wiring for loose connections or exposed insulation.
- Clear any blockages in ventilation slats or drainage holes.

### **3.2 Adding New Material**

- Add fresh organic material to the compost pile as needed.
- Ensure a balance between high-moisture (e.g., fruit waste) and dry materials (e.g., paper).

### **3.3 Cleaning and Clearing**

- Clean the exterior of the box with a damp cloth to remove dirt or residue.
- Empty the soil tray of accumulated leachate if present and clean it thoroughly.

## **4. Advanced Tips for Optimal Performance**

### **4.1 Maximizing Energy Output**

- Regularly reapply graphene spray to the electrodes to maintain conductivity.
- Insulate the box during cold seasons to maintain microbial activity.

### **4.2 Enhancing Compost Quality**

- Add diverse materials to the compost for a richer nutrient profile.
- Include materials rich in carbon (e.g., sawdust) and nitrogen (e.g., vegetable scraps) for better decomposition.

### **4.3 Managing Leachate**

- Use the collected leachate as a liquid fertilizer for plants.
- Dilute it with water (1:10 ratio) to avoid over-fertilizing.

## **5. Safety Precautions**

- Wear gloves while handling compost or leachate to prevent skin irritation.
- Keep the box away from direct contact with rainwater to avoid excess moisture buildup.
- Avoid adding non-compostable materials such as plastics, metals, or treated wood.
