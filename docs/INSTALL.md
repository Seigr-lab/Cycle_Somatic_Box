## **1. Materials and Tools**

### Materials

- **Wood**:
  - Locally sourced wood panels (treated or untreated, depending on your preference).
  - Wood dimensions: Four panels for walls (1m x 1m each), one for the lid, and one for the base.

- **3D-Printed Components**:
  - Electrode meshes (4 anodes and 8 cathodes, as specified in DESIGN.md).
  - Cable guides and electrode mounts (if required).

- **Coatings and Sealants**:
  - **Graphene spray** for electrode coating.
  - Linseed oil or an equivalent non-toxic wood treatment.
  - Waterproof sealant for the wood (optional).

- **Wiring**:
  - Moisture-resistant silicone-insulated wires.
  - Screw terminals or waterproof connectors for wiring.

- **Power Regulation Components**:
  - DC-DC step-up converter (compatible with 11-48V EcoFlow Power Kit input).
  - Capacitors for voltage stabilization.

- **Miscellaneous**:
  - Hinges and a handle for the lid.
  - Stainless steel screws or nails.
  - Vents (slats or custom 3D-printed).

### Tools

- Saw and drill.
- Screwdriver set.
- Sandpaper or orbital sander.
- Soldering iron and solder (for wiring).
- 3D printer (e.g., Creality Ender-5 S1).
- Paintbrush or cloth for wood treatment.
- Multimeter (for voltage and current testing).

## **2. Step-by-Step Assembly**

### Step 1: Treat the Wood

1. **Shou Sugi Ban (Optional)**:
   - Use a propane torch to char the wood surface lightly.
   - Sand the surface to remove soot, leaving a smooth, durable finish.
   - This step enhances resistance to rot, pests, and weather.

2. **Apply Protective Treatments**:
   - Coat the wood with linseed oil or another natural wood treatment.
   - Allow to dry fully before assembly.

3. **Seal the Wood (Optional)**:
   - Apply a waterproof, non-toxic sealant if the box will be exposed to rain or high humidity.

### Step 2: Assemble the Box

1. **Walls**:
   - Attach the four 1m x 1m panels together using screws or mortise and tenon joints.
   - Ensure the upper sections of the walls include vent openings or slats for airflow.

2. **Base**:
   - Attach the 1m x 1m base panel to the walls. Reinforce with screws or brackets.
   - Ensure there are small perforations or drainage points in the corners to manage leachate.

3. **Lid**:
   - Attach the lid to the box using hinges.
   - Install a handle for easy opening and closing.
   - Add ventilation slats or holes to the lid.

### Step 3: Prepare the Electrodes

1. **Print the Electrodes**:
   - Use your 3D printer to create the electrode meshes:
     - **Anodes**: Four 50cm x 50cm perforated panels.
     - **Cathodes**: Eight 50cm x 25cm panels.

2. **Apply Graphene Spray**:
   - Coat the printed meshes with a layer of graphene spray to enhance conductivity.
   - Allow the coating to dry completely before handling.

3. **Install the Electrodes**:
   - Position the anode panels in the anaerobic zone at the base of the box.
   - Mount the cathode panels near the top of the composting zone or along the walls, where oxygen exposure is optimal.

### Step 4: Wiring and Power Integration

1. **Connect the Electrodes**:
   - Wire the anode and cathode panels in series or parallel configurations, depending on your voltage and current requirements.
   - Route the wires through moisture-protected cable guides or grooves in the wooden structure.

2. **Install the Power Regulation System**:
   - Connect the electrode output to the DC-DC step-up converter.
   - Install capacitors to stabilize the voltage.

3. **Test the Electrical Output**:
   - Use a multimeter to ensure the system is generating the expected voltage and current.
   - Verify the output is compatible with the EcoFlow Power Kit (11-48V).

4. **Integrate with EcoFlow**:
   - Connect the regulated output to the EcoFlow solar panel input port.
   - Test the connection to ensure proper energy storage.

### Step 5: Final Assembly and Testing

1. **Add Ventilation**:
   - Install vents or slats on the walls and lid to allow proper aeration.

2. **Secure the Lid**:
   - Test the hinges and handle to ensure the lid is stable during operation.

3. **Test Drainage**:
   - Pour a small amount of water into the composting zone and ensure leachate drains properly through the perforations.

4. **Trial Composting**:
   - Add a small amount of organic waste and monitor the microbial activity over several days.
   - Test energy generation during this trial period.

## **3. Maintenance and Troubleshooting**

### Maintenance

- **Electrodes**:
  - Inspect the graphene coating periodically and reapply if conductivity decreases.
- **Wood**:
  - Reapply linseed oil annually or as needed to maintain moisture resistance.
- **Wires**:
  - Check for wear or corrosion and replace damaged wiring.

### Troubleshooting

- **Low Voltage Output**:
  - Check electrode connections for damage or poor contact.
  - Ensure compost moisture levels are optimal (not too wet or dry).

- **Poor Composting**:
  - Adjust aeration or moisture levels.
  - Add composting activators like bokashi bran if microbial activity is slow.

## **4. Safety Notes**

- When using a torch for wood treatment, work in a well-ventilated area and follow fire safety guidelines.
- Handle the graphene spray in a well-ventilated area and wear protective gloves.
- Always test the electrical output with a multimeter before connecting to the EcoFlow system.
