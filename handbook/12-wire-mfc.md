# Step 12: Wire the MFC System

**What you're doing**: Connect all electrodes together to create a working electrical system that outputs usable power.

## Understanding the Connections

**Basic circuit**:

- Bottom electrodes are anodes (negative)
- Top electrodes are cathodes (positive)
- Middle electrodes add extra voltage
- All connect to make complete circuit

## Wiring Strategy

**Series connection** (recommended):

- Connects anodes to cathodes in chain
- Adds up voltages from each pair
- Total voltage = sum of all pairs

**Parallel option**:

- All anodes connect together
- All cathodes connect together  
- Higher current but lower voltage

## Making Connections

**Outside the container**:

- Bring all wires out through one hole
- Make connections in weatherproof box
- Easier to maintain and modify

**Wire organization**:

- Label each wire clearly
- Use wire nuts or terminal blocks
- Keep connections dry and secure

**Final output**:

- Two main wires: positive and negative
- These will connect to power management system
- Test voltage with multimeter

## Testing Your MFC

**Before adding compost**:

- Should show small voltage (0.1-0.3V)
- Connections should be solid
- No short circuits

**After adding compost**:

- Voltage will increase over time
- May take days to weeks for full output
- Target: 3-12V depending on configuration

## What You Need

- [ ] Weatherproof electrical box
- [ ] Wire nuts or terminal blocks
- [ ] Electrical tape and heat shrink tubing
- [ ] Multimeter for testing
- [ ] Labels for wire identification
