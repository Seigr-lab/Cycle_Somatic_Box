# Step 19: Install Power Hub

**What you're doing**: Connect all energy streams to a central power management system that combines and regulates the electricity.

## Power Hub Purpose

**Combines all energy sources**:

- MFC system (3-12V)
- Peltier modules (4-20V)
- Streaming potential (0.5-2V)
- Atmospheric collection (0.1-1V)

**Manages power output**:

- Regulates voltage to stable level
- Combines different voltage sources
- Provides standard output connections

## Hub Components

**Multi-input charge controller**:

- Handles multiple DC inputs
- MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) preferred
- 12V or 24V system voltage

**DC-DC converters**:

- Boost low voltages to usable levels
- Convert to standard voltages (12V, 24V)
- High efficiency switching converters

## Installation Location

**Weatherproof enclosure**:

- Protects electronics from moisture
- Easy access for maintenance
- Near container but not on it

**Ventilation**:

- Electronics generate heat
- Prevent condensation buildup
- Allow air circulation

## Wiring All Systems

**Input connections**:

- Label each energy system clearly
- Use appropriate wire gauges
- Install fuses for protection

**System positive and negative**:

- MFC system: main DC output
- Peltier modules: higher voltage DC
- Streaming potential: low voltage DC
- Atmospheric spikes: variable voltage DC

## Testing Combined Output

**Individual system testing**:

- Test each energy source separately
- Verify voltage levels and polarity
- Check for proper operation

**Combined system testing**:

- Connect all systems to hub
- Measure total power output
- Verify voltage regulation
