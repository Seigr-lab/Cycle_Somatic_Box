# Step 06: Create Zone Dividers

**What you're doing**: Make internal dividers to separate different composting zones for maximum energy generation.

## Why Zones Matter

**Different zones generate different energy**:

- Bottom zone: anaerobic composting (MFC anodes)
- Middle zone: transition area (gradient capture)
- Top zone: aerobic composting (MFC cathodes)

**Better composting**:

- Prevents material from settling into one mass
- Allows different decomposition stages
- Improves air and water circulation

## Divider Materials

**Plastic mesh or hardware cloth**:

- Allows water and air to pass through
- Separates materials by zone
- Easy to cut and install

**Perforated plastic sheets**:

- Cut from storage containers
- Drill lots of holes for drainage
- More solid separation

## Making the Dividers

**Two dividers needed**:

- Lower divider: 1/3 up from bottom
- Upper divider: 2/3 up from bottom

**Cutting**:

- Measure inside diameter of container
- Cut dividers slightly smaller than container
- Round corners to fit container shape

## Installing Dividers

**Support method**:

- Drill small holes in container sides
- Insert plastic rods or dowels through holes
- Rest dividers on these supports

**Bracket method**:

- Attach small brackets to container walls
- Set dividers on brackets
- Use zip ties to secure if needed

## What You Need

- [ ] Mesh or perforated material for 2 dividers
- [ ] Support rods or brackets
- [ ] Drill and small bits
- [ ] Zip ties (optional)
