# Step 17: Install Conductive Spikes

**What you're doing**: Add metal spikes that collect atmospheric electrical charges and convert them to usable power.

## Atmospheric Charge Basics

**What it captures**:

- Natural electrical charges in atmosphere
- Static electricity from weather changes
- Small charge differential between air and ground

**How it works**:

- Conductive spikes extend above container
- Collect charges from air movement
- Creates voltage difference with ground reference

## Spike Specifications

**Material**: Stainless steel or copper

- Must resist corrosion
- Good electrical conductivity
- Sharp points for charge collection

**Size**: 2-4 feet tall, pointed tips
**Quantity**: 4-6 spikes around container perimeter

## Installation

**Mounting**:

- Secure to container lid or top edge
- Spikes extend well above container
- Stable in wind and weather

**Spacing**:

- Evenly distributed around container
- Don't cluster in one area
- Consider prevailing wind direction

## Wiring

**Spike connections**:

- Wire from each spike to collection system
- Use corrosion-resistant connections
- Waterproof all electrical connections

**Ground reference**:

- Connect to metal container or ground rod
- Creates potential difference with spikes
- Essential for charge collection

## Safety Considerations

**Lightning protection**:

- Add surge protectors to spike circuits
- Consider lightning arrestors
- Never work on spikes during storms

**Height limits**:

- Keep spikes reasonable height
- Don't create lightning hazard
- Check local electrical codes

## What You Need

- [ ] 4-6 metal spikes (stainless steel or copper)
- [ ] Mounting hardware for spikes
- [ ] Surge protection devices
