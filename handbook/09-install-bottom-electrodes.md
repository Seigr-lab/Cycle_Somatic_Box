# Step 09: Install Bottom Electrodes

**What you're doing**: Place the anode electrodes in the bottom zone where they'll collect electrons from anaerobic composting.

## Why Bottom Zone

**Anaerobic conditions**:

- Less oxygen at bottom of compost
- Perfect for electron-producing microbes
- These electrodes become "anodes" (negative terminal)

## Positioning the Electrodes

**Number needed**: 6 large electrodes in bottom zone

**Spacing**:

- Spread evenly across bottom area
- Leave space between for compost material
- Position so wires can reach outside container

**Height**:

- Sit on container bottom
- Just below lower divider
- Contact with bottom compost layer

## Installation Process

**Mark positions**:

- Plan electrode locations before installing
- Mark spots on container bottom
- Ensure wires can route to side

**Install supports**:

- Small blocks or stands to hold electrodes level
- Can use plastic pieces or ceramic tiles
- Keep electrodes stable but allow compost contact

**Route wires**:

- Attach wire to each electrode mounting tab
- Run wires up container wall to exit point
- Use different colored wires for organization

**Test placement**:

- Make sure electrodes don't block drainage holes
- Verify all can be reached for maintenance
- Check that divider will fit above them

## What You Need

- [ ] 6 coated large electrodes
- [ ] Insulated wire (6 different colors helpful)
- [ ] Small supports or stands for electrodes
- [ ] Wire strippers and electrical connections
