# Step 24: Start Energy Generation

**What you're doing**: Begin using your system to generate and store electricity for practical use.

## Initial Operation

**First week**:

- Monitor all systems daily
- Document power output
- Make small adjustments as needed
- Don't expect full power yet

**System maturation**:

- MFC microbes need time to establish
- Performance improves over 4-6 weeks
- Be patient with initial low output

## Power Output Tracking

**Measure daily**:

- Total system voltage
- Current under standard load
- Calculate power (P = V × I)
- Record in logbook

**Expected progression**:

- Week 1: 1-3 watts
- Week 4: 5-10 watts  
- Week 8: 8-15 watts
- Mature system: 10-25 watts

## Using Your Generated Power

**Start with small loads**:

- LED lights
- Phone chargers
- Small fans
- Radio or small electronics

**EcoFlow Power Kit benefits**:

- Stores energy when generation exceeds use
- Provides power when generation is low
- Standard outlets for household devices

## Optimizing Performance

**Seasonal adjustments**:

- Winter: Maximum thermal differential
- Summer: Manage overheating
- Rainy seasons: Good for streaming potential
- Dry periods: Monitor moisture levels

**Maintenance routine**:

- Check electrical connections monthly
- Monitor compost moisture and temperature
- Clean atmospheric spike connections
- Update EcoFlow app and settings

## Scaling Up

**If you want more power**:

- Add second container system
- Install additional Peltier modules
- Expand atmospheric spike array
- Consider larger EcoFlow Power Kit

## System Integration

**Grid-tie options** (advanced):

- Micro-inverter for AC output
- Net metering where permitted
- Battery bank expansion
- Automatic load switching

## What You Need

- [ ] Load testing equipment
- [ ] Power measurement tools
- [ ] Logbook for tracking performance
- [ ] Small electrical loads for testing
