# Step 20: Create Power Storage System

**What you're doing**: Build a power storage and management system using recycled batteries and electronics.

## Sustainable Power Storage Options

**Recycled battery systems**:

- Old UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) units
- Salvaged car batteries (test capacity first)
- Laptop batteries (combine multiple packs)
- Power tool battery packs (often discarded when "dead")

**DIY charge controllers**:

- Arduino-based charge controller projects
- Salvaged solar charge controllers
- Simple diode-based charging circuits
- Repurposed power supply units

**Alternative to expensive commercial systems**:

- Build instead of buy
- Learn electronics while building
- Much cheaper using recycled components
- More educational and aligned with Seigr values

## Connection Setup

**DC input connection**:

- Use Power Kit's DC input terminals
- Match polarity carefully (positive to positive)
- Use appropriate wire gauge for current

**Input protection**:

- Install DC disconnect switch
- Add fuse protection at Power Kit
- Label connections clearly

## Configuration

**Power Kit settings**:

- Set input voltage range to match your system
- Configure charging parameters
- Enable MPPT mode for maximum efficiency

**Monitoring setup**:

- Connect to EcoFlow mobile app
- Monitor input power and battery charging
- Track daily energy harvest

## System Integration

**Backup power**:

- Power Kit provides backup when generation is low
- Battery storage for nighttime use
- Consistent power output regardless of weather

**Load management**:

- Connect your household loads to Power Kit
- AC outlets for standard appliances
- DC outlets for efficient DC loads

## Testing Integration

**Initial connection test**:

- Start with no loads connected
- Verify Power Kit recognizes input
- Check charging indicators

**Load testing**:

- Add small loads gradually
- Monitor power flow and battery status
- Verify system handles varying generation

## What You Need

- [ ] Recycled batteries (UPS, car, laptop packs)
- [ ] Salvaged wire and connectors
- [ ] Basic electronics components (diodes, fuses)
- [ ] Multimeter for testing and monitoring
- [ ] Basic tools for electronics work
