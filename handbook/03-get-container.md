# Step 03: Get Your Container

**What you're doing**: Get a suitable container for your energy-generating composting box.

## Container Requirements

**Size**: Large enough to hold composting materials and all energy systems

- **Minimum**: 50 gallons (200 liters)
- **Recommended**: 80-100 gallons (300-400 liters)
- **Dimensions**: At least 3 feet tall for proper layering

## Good Container Options

**Plastic storage containers**:

- Rubbermaid or similar heavy-duty containers
- Food-grade is nice but not required
- Must have tight-fitting lid

**Metal containers**:

- Old water heaters (remove heating elements)
- Large metal drums
- Stainless steel preferred but not required

**Avoid**:

- Containers that held chemicals
- Very thin plastic that cracks easily
- Containers without lids

## What to Look For

When choosing your container:

- [ ] Strong enough to hold soil and compost
- [ ] Has a lid or can get one
- [ ] You can drill holes in it
- [ ] Fits in your chosen location

## Where to Get Containers

- Hardware stores (new containers)
- Restaurant supply stores (used food containers)
- Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace (used)
- Appliance recyclers (old water heaters)
