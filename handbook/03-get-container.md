# Step 03: Build Your Wood Container

**What you're doing**: Build a sustainable wooden container using recycled materials - the original Seigr way.

## Why Wood Construction

**Aligns with Seigr ethos**:

- Use recycled/reclaimed materials
- Avoid plastic pollution
- Build sustainably, don't buy new
- Work with natural, biodegradable materials

## Container Requirements

**Size**: Large enough for composting and energy systems

- **Minimum**: 200 liters (3x3x2 feet)
- **Recommended**: 300-400 liters (3x3x3 feet)
- **Dimensions**: At least 3 feet tall for proper zone layering

## Wood Materials (Recycled/Free Sources)

**Best options**:

- Pallet wood (free from businesses)
- Reclaimed fence boards
- Old shipping crates
- Construction site scraps (with permission)

**Avoid**:

- Treated lumber (chemicals harm composting microbes)
- Wood that held chemicals or paint
- Rotted or damaged wood

## Basic Wood Box Construction

**Simple box design**:

- Four walls, bottom, and lid
- Corner joints with screws or nails
- No complex joinery needed
- Functional over fancy

**Tools needed**:

- Saw (hand saw works fine)
- Drill for screws
- Measuring tape
- Basic hand tools

## Alternative: Repurpose Existing

**Free/recycled containers**:

- Old wooden crates or boxes
- Discarded furniture (drawers, cabinets)
- Wooden planters (enlarge if needed)
- Ask local businesses for wooden shipping containers
