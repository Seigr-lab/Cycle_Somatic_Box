# Step 23: Test All Systems

**What you're doing**: Verify that each energy system is working and producing electricity as expected.

## Individual System Testing

**MFC system testing**:

- Check voltage across each electrode pair
- Test total MFC system voltage
- Verify gradual voltage increase over days

**Peltier module testing**:

- Measure voltage from each module
- Check temperature difference between hot/cold sides  
- Test in different weather conditions

**Streaming potential testing**:

- Test each ceramic tube individually
- Measure combined streaming system voltage
- Verify moisture levels are adequate

**Atmospheric collection testing**:

- Check each spike connection
- Test during different weather conditions
- Verify surge protection is working

## Combined System Testing

**Power hub testing**:

- All inputs connected and functioning
- Total system voltage measured
- Load testing with small resistors

**EcoFlow integration testing**:

- Power Kit recognizing input
- Battery charging from your system
- Monitor app showing power flow

## Performance Expectations

**Initial performance** (first week):

- MFC: 0.1-0.5V per pair
- Peltier: 1-3V per module  
- Streaming: 50-200mV per tube
- Atmospheric: 0-500mV

**Mature performance** (after 4-6 weeks):

- MFC: 0.5-0.8V per pair
- Peltier: 2-5V per module
- Streaming: 100-300mV per tube
- Atmospheric: Variable, weather dependent

## Troubleshooting Issues

**Low or no voltage**:

- Check all connections
- Verify electrode coating integrity
- Test individual components

**Inconsistent output**:

- Moisture level problems
- Temperature variations
- Connection corrosion

## Documentation

**Keep testing log**:

- Daily voltage measurements
- Weather conditions
- Any issues or changes made
- Performance trends over time

## What You Need

- [ ] Multimeter for voltage testing
- [ ] Load resistors for testing
- [ ] Notebook for recording results
- [ ] Camera to document any issues
