# Step 11: Install Top Electrodes

**What you're doing**: Place cathode electrodes in the aerobic zone where oxygen helps complete the electrical circuit.

## Top Zone Function

**Aerobic conditions**:

- Plenty of oxygen from ventilation
- Perfect for cathode reactions
- Completes the electrical circuit with bottom electrodes

## Positioning

**Number needed**: 6 large electrodes  

**Location**:

- Top zone above upper divider
- Near ventilation holes for oxygen access
- Still in contact with compost materials

## Installation

**Mount in top zone**:

- Position electrodes in upper compost area
- Ensure good oxygen access from ventilation
- Maintain contact with composting materials

**Support method**:

- Can rest on upper divider
- Use brackets if needed for stability
- Keep electrodes accessible for maintenance

**Wire connections**:

- Connect wires to each electrode
- Route all wires to same exit point
- Keep wires organized and labeled

## Complete the Circuit

**Electrode pairs**:

- Each bottom electrode pairs with a top electrode
- Creates complete electrical circuit through compost
- Test continuity with multimeter

## What You Need

- [ ] 6 coated large electrodes
- [ ] Wire for connections  
- [ ] Mounting hardware if needed
- [ ] Multimeter for testing circuits
