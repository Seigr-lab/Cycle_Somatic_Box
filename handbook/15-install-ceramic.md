# Step 15: Install Ceramic Tubes

**What you're doing**: Add ceramic tubes that generate electricity from water and ion movement through your composting system.

## Streaming Potential Basics

**What it captures**:

- Electricity from water flowing through porous materials
- Ion movement creates small voltages
- Works continuously when moisture is present

**Why ceramic tubes**:

- Porous ceramic allows ion flow
- Creates electrical potential across tube walls
- Many small voltages add up to usable power

## Finding Ceramic Tubes

**Recycled sources**:

- Old terracotta drain pipes (construction sites)
- Broken ceramic planters (use intact pieces)  
- Discarded pool/aquarium filter ceramics
- Old pottery projects (unglazed pieces)
- Clay pipes from demolished buildings

**DIY alternatives**:

- Roll clay and fire in campfire (unglazed)
- Bamboo tubes (naturally porous when aged)
- Wooden tubes with small holes drilled

**Size**: Whatever you can find - any size helps
**Quantity**: Use whatever you can source - even 2-3 tubes contribute

## Installation Pattern

**Vertical installation**:

- Insert tubes vertically into compost zones
- Top of tube near surface
- Bottom of tube in deeper, wetter compost

**Spacing**:

- Distribute evenly throughout container
- Don't cluster all in one area
- Leave space for other components

## Wiring the Tubes

**Electrode placement**:

- One wire inside tube
- One wire outside tube  
- Creates potential difference across ceramic wall

**Recycled wire sources**:

- Old stainless steel kitchen utensils (straightened)
- Salvaged wire from electronic devices
- Car antenna rods (stainless steel)
- Even copper wire from old electronics works initially

## Moisture Management

**Keep tubes moist**:

- Streaming potential needs water flow
- Position where compost moisture will reach
- May need occasional watering in dry conditions

## What You Need

- [ ] Recycled ceramic tubes or alternatives (see sources above)
- [ ] Salvaged stainless steel or copper wire
- [ ] Waterproof materials (old plastic bags, tape)
- [ ] Basic tools for positioning
