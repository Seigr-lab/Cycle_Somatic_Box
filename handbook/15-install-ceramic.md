# Step 15: Install Ceramic Tubes

**What you're doing**: Add ceramic tubes that generate electricity from water and ion movement through your composting system.

## Streaming Potential Basics

**What it captures**:

- Electricity from water flowing through porous materials
- Ion movement creates small voltages
- Works continuously when moisture is present

**Why ceramic tubes**:

- Porous ceramic allows ion flow
- Creates electrical potential across tube walls
- Many small voltages add up to usable power

## Tube Specifications

**Material**: Unglazed ceramic (porous)

- Pottery tubes work well
- Pool filter ceramic elements
- Scientific ceramic tubes (if available)

**Size**: 6-12 inches long, 1-2 inches diameter
**Quantity**: 8-12 tubes for good power output

## Installation Pattern

**Vertical installation**:

- Insert tubes vertically into compost zones
- Top of tube near surface
- Bottom of tube in deeper, wetter compost

**Spacing**:

- Distribute evenly throughout container
- Don't cluster all in one area
- Leave space for other components

## Wiring the Tubes

**Electrode placement**:

- One wire inside tube
- One wire outside tube
- Creates potential difference across ceramic wall

**Wire material**:

- Stainless steel or carbon fiber
- Resist corrosion in wet conditions
- Connect to collection system

## Moisture Management

**Keep tubes moist**:

- Streaming potential needs water flow
- Position where compost moisture will reach
- May need occasional watering in dry conditions

## What You Need
