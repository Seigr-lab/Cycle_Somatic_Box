# Step 25: Maintain Your System

**What you're doing**: Keep your energy-generating composting system running efficiently with regular maintenance.

## Daily Maintenance

**Quick visual check**:

- System is generating power (check EcoFlow app)
- No obvious physical damage
- Compost moisture looks appropriate

**Weekly checks**:

- Add kitchen scraps and compost materials
- Check total system voltage
- Monitor EcoFlow battery levels

## Monthly Maintenance

**Electrical systems**:

- Test all connections for corrosion
- Check wire condition and routing
- Verify surge protectors are functional
- Clean atmospheric spike connections

**Composting system**:

- Turn or mix upper compost layers
- Add brown materials if too wet/smelly
- Check moisture levels throughout zones
- Monitor compost temperature

**Performance monitoring**:

- Record monthly power output
- Compare to previous months
- Check for declining performance

## Seasonal Maintenance

**Spring**:

- Clean winter debris from spikes
- Add fresh compost materials
- Check for moisture damage to electronics

**Summer**:

- Monitor for overheating
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Adjust thermal management if needed

**Fall**:

- Prepare for winter temperature differentials
- Check insulation integrity
- Stock up on brown compost materials

**Winter**:

- Maximum thermal power generation period
- Protect connections from freezing
- Monitor for ice damage to spikes

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Power output declining**:

- Check electrode connections
- Refresh compost materials
- Test individual system components

**Bad odors from compost**:

- Add more brown materials
- Improve ventilation
- Check moisture levels

**Electrical problems**:

- Test connections systematically
- Look for corrosion or damage
- Replace components as needed

## Long-term Performance

**System lifespan**:

- Electronics: 5-10 years
- Electrodes: 2-5 years (replaceable)
- Container: 10+ years with good maintenance

**Upgrade opportunities**:

- Better electrode materials
- More efficient power electronics
- Additional energy collection systems

## Record Keeping

**Maintenance log**:

- Date and type of maintenance performed
- Parts replaced or repaired
- Performance measurements
- Seasonal observations

**Performance tracking**:

- Monthly power generation totals
- Peak power measurements
- Efficiency trends over time

## What You Need

- [ ] Basic electrical testing tools
- [ ] Spare fuses and electrical components
- [ ] Compost materials for ongoing feeding
- [ ] Cleaning supplies for connections
- [ ] Maintenance logbook

**Congratulations!** You now have a complete energy-generating composting system that provides renewable electricity while processing organic waste. Your system will provide years of clean energy with proper maintenance.
