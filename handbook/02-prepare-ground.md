# Step 02: Prepare the Ground

**What you're doing**: Get the ground ready for your composting box installation.

## Clear the Area

**Size needed**: 3 feet x 3 feet (1 meter x 1 meter)

**Clear away**:

- Grass and weeds
- Rocks and debris  
- Any surface roots

**Keep the soil**: You'll use this soil later in your composting layers.

## Level the Ground

**Make it roughly level**:

- Use a shovel to remove high spots
- Fill in low spots with soil
- Pack down gently with your foot

**Don't need perfect**: Just level enough that your container won't tip.

## Test Drainage

**Pour a bucket of water** on your prepared area:

- Water should soak in within 30 minutes
- If it pools, choose a different spot or add drainage

## What You Need

- [ ] Shovel
- [ ] Rake (optional)
- [ ] Bucket of water for drainage test
