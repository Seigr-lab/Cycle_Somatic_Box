# Step 08: Apply Conductive Coating

**What you're doing**: Make your plastic electrodes electrically conductive so they can capture energy from microbes.

## Why Coating Is Needed

**Plastic doesn't conduct electricity**:

- Microbes produce electrons
- Electrons need to flow to wires
- Conductive coating captures the electrons

## Coating Materials

**Graphite powder**:

- Main conductive ingredient
- Available at art stores or online
- Mix with acrylic paint or binder

**Simple coating recipe**:

- 2 parts graphite powder
- 1 part acrylic paint (any color)
- Water to thin if needed

## Applying the Coating

**Preparation**:

- Clean electrode pieces with alcohol
- Work in well-ventilated area
- Have brushes and mixing containers ready

**Mixing**:

- Mix graphite and paint thoroughly
- Add water drops until paint-like consistency
- Test on scrap piece first

**Application**:

- Apply thin, even coats with brush
- Cover all surfaces, especially holes
- Let first coat dry completely
- Apply second coat for better coverage

## Drying and Testing

**Drying**:

- Air dry 24 hours between coats
- Keep dust-free while drying
- Don't rush the process

**Testing conductivity**:

- Use multimeter to test resistance
- Should show low resistance across surface
- Recoat any high-resistance areas
