# Step 05: Add Insulation

**What you're doing**: Insulate your container to help thermal energy harvesting and maintain composting temperatures.

## Why Insulation Helps

**Better energy generation**:

- Creates temperature differences for thermal harvesting
- Maintains steady composting temperatures
- Reduces heat loss in winter

**Better composting**:

- Keeps compost active in cold weather
- More consistent decomposition
- Faster compost production

## Recycled Insulation Materials

**Free/recycled options**:

- Old blankets, sleeping bags, or comforters
- Newspaper (multiple layers in plastic bags)
- Cardboard (corrugated works best)
- Old clothes stuffed into fabric bags
- Straw or hay (if available locally)
- Sawdust in fabric sacks

**Reclaimed building materials**:

- Reclaimed foam board from construction sites
- Old packaging foam (clean, non-toxic only)
- Discarded camping gear insulation

**Avoid**:

- New plastic foam products
- Materials that absorb and hold water permanently
- Anything with toxic chemicals or strong odors

## How to Install

**Foam board method** (recommended):

- Measure container sides
- Cut foam boards to fit
- Attach with construction adhesive or zip ties
- Leave ventilation holes uncovered

**Wrap method**:

- Wrap container in insulation material
- Secure with duct tape or zip ties
- Make sure lid can still open
- Keep holes clear

## What You Need

- [ ] Recycled insulation materials (see options above)
- [ ] Basic cutting tools (knife, scissors)
- [ ] Attachment method (old zip ties, rope, or fabric strips)
- [ ] Waterproof covering if needed (old plastic bags, tarp scraps)
