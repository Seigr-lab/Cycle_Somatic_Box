# Step 05: Add Insulation

**What you're doing**: Insulate your container to help thermal energy harvesting and maintain composting temperatures.

## Why Insulation Helps

**Better energy generation**:

- Creates temperature differences for thermal harvesting
- Maintains steady composting temperatures
- Reduces heat loss in winter

**Better composting**:

- Keeps compost active in cold weather
- More consistent decomposition
- Faster compost production

## Insulation Materials

**Good options**:

- Foam board insulation (easiest)
- Reflective bubble wrap insulation
- Old blankets or sleeping bags
- Styrofoam sheets

**Avoid**:

- Materials that absorb water
- Anything that can rot
- Toxic materials

## How to Install

**Foam board method** (recommended):

- Measure container sides
- Cut foam boards to fit
- Attach with construction adhesive or zip ties
- Leave ventilation holes uncovered

**Wrap method**:

- Wrap container in insulation material
- Secure with duct tape or zip ties
- Make sure lid can still open
- Keep holes clear

## What You Need

- [ ] Insulation material for your container size
- [ ] Knife or saw to cut insulation
- [ ] Adhesive or zip ties to attach
- [ ] Duct tape for securing edges
