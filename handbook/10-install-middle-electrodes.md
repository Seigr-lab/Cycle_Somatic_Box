# Step 10: Install Middle Electrodes

**What you're doing**: Place electrodes in the transition zone to capture energy from pH and chemical gradients.

## Middle Zone Purpose

**Transition area**:

- Between aerobic and anaerobic zones
- Chemical gradients form naturally here
- Extra voltage from gradient differences

## Positioning

**Number needed**: 4 medium electrodes

**Location**:

- On the lower divider
- Spaced evenly around divider
- Contact both upper and lower zones

## Installation

**Mount on divider**:

- Attach electrodes to top of lower divider
- Use zip ties or brackets to secure
- Position for maximum zone contact

**Wire routing**:

- Connect wire to each electrode
- Route wires to exit with other wires
- Use different colors for identification

**Test fit**:

- Make sure upper divider still fits
- Verify electrodes don't interfere with composting
- Check wire routing is clean

## What You Need

- [ ] 4 coated medium electrodes
- [ ] Wire for connections
- [ ] Zip ties or mounting brackets
- [ ] Wire management materials
