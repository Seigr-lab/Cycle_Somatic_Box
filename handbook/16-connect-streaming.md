# Step 16: Connect Streaming Collectors

**What you're doing**: Wire together all ceramic tubes to create a streaming potential collection system.

## Wiring Strategy

**Series connection recommended**:

- Connects positive of one tube to negative of next
- Adds up voltages from all tubes
- Higher total voltage output

**Parallel option**:

- All positives together, all negatives together
- Higher current, lower voltage
- Use if individual tube voltages are high

## Making Connections

**Identify tube polarity**:

- Test each tube with multimeter
- Mark positive and negative ends
- Voltage will be small (50-200 millivolts per tube)

**Connect in series**:

- Positive of tube 1 to negative of tube 2
- Continue chain through all tubes
- Two final wires: system positive and negative

## Waterproofing

**All connections must be waterproof**:

- Use heat shrink tubing
- Waterproof wire nuts
- Electrical tape as backup

**Route wires safely**:

- Away from high-moisture areas
- Secure to prevent pulling
- Label for easy identification

## Testing the System

**Voltage measurement**:

- Series: should equal sum of individual tubes
- Parallel: should equal individual tube voltage
- Total system: 0.5-2V typical

**Load testing**:

- Connect small resistor (1000 ohms)
- Measure current flow
- Calculate power (P = V × I)
