# Step 18: Add Lightning Protection

**What you're doing**: Install safety devices to protect your system and property from lightning strikes.

## Why Protection Is Critical

**Conductive spikes can attract lightning**:

- Metal spikes conduct electricity
- Lightning follows path of least resistance
- Must safely redirect dangerous energy

**Protect your investment**:

- Lightning can destroy all electronics
- Fire hazard to property
- Personal safety concern

## Protection Devices

**Lightning arrestors**:

- Install between spikes and system
- Diverts high voltage to ground
- Rated for your spike voltage

**Surge protectors**:

- Protect sensitive electronics
- Install at power hub input
- Replace after any nearby strikes

## Grounding System

**Dedicated ground rod**:

- 8-foot copper rod driven into earth
- Separate from house electrical ground
- Direct path for lightning energy

**Ground connections**:

- Heavy copper wire (4 AWG minimum)
- Direct route to ground rod
- No sharp bends or loops

## Installation

**Arrestor placement**:

- Between each spike and collection circuit
- As close to spikes as possible
- Weatherproof enclosure

**Ground wire routing**:

- Shortest path to ground rod
- Away from other electrical systems
- Secure and protected from damage

## Testing

**Ground resistance**:

- Should be less than 25 ohms
- Test annually or after strikes
- Add additional ground rods if needed

**System continuity**:

- Verify all ground connections
- Test arrestor operation
- Check surge protector indicators

## What You Need

- [ ] Lightning arrestors (one per spike)
- [ ] 8-foot copper ground rod
- [ ] 4 AWG copper ground wire
- [ ] Ground rod clamps
- [ ] Ground resistance tester (optional)
