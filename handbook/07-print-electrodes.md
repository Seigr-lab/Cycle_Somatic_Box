# Step 07: Create Electrode Structures

**What you're doing**: Build electrode structures from sustainable materials that will generate electricity from your compost.

## What Are Electrodes

**Electricity generators**:

- Capture electrons from composting microbes
- Work like a battery that runs on compost
- Need perforated structures for microbe contact

## Electrode Types Needed

**Large electrodes** (6 pieces):

- Go in bottom zone (anodes)
- Go in top zone (cathodes)  
- Size: about 10 inches x 10 inches

**Medium electrodes** (4 pieces):

- Go in middle transition zone
- Size: about 8 inches x 8 inches

## Sustainable Construction Methods

**3D printing with biodegradable materials**:

- Print with PLA+ (biodegradable corn starch)
- Wood-filled PLA filament (wood fiber + biodegradable binder)
- Hemp-based 3D printing filament

**Manual construction from recycled materials**:

- Perforated metal sheets (from old appliances)
- Hardware cloth or mesh (construction scraps)
- Wooden frames with metal mesh inserts
- Repurposed kitchen strainers or colanders

**Reclaimed material sources**:

- Old computer case fans (remove electronics, keep frame)
- Discarded cooking equipment with holes
- Construction site mesh and screening

## Design Requirements

**All electrodes need**:

- Lots of holes for microbe contact
- Mounting tabs for easy installation
- Channels for wire connections
- Hollow areas to fill with carbon material

## What You Need

- [ ] Biodegradable 3D printing material OR recycled perforated materials
- [ ] Basic tools for cutting/shaping (if using manual construction)
- [ ] Wire mesh or hardware cloth (from construction scraps)
