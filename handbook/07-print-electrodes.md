# Step 07: Print Electrode Pieces

**What you're doing**: Get the plastic electrode structures that will generate electricity from your compost.

## What Are Electrodes

**Electricity generators**:

- Capture electrons from composting microbes
- Work like a battery that runs on compost
- Need special shapes with holes for microbe contact

## Electrode Types Needed

**Large electrodes** (6 pieces):

- Go in bottom zone (anodes)
- Go in top zone (cathodes)
- Size: about 10 inches x 10 inches

**Medium electrodes** (4 pieces):

- Go in middle transition zone
- Size: about 8 inches x 8 inches

## Getting Your Electrodes

**3D printing** (if you have access):

- Use provided STL design files
- Print in PLA plastic
- 15% infill is fine

**Print service**:

- Upload files to online printing service
- Libraries often have 3D printers
- Community makerspaces

**Alternative - manual construction**:

- Cut from plastic sheets
- Drill holes in regular pattern
- Less efficient but works

## Design Requirements

**All electrodes need**:

- Lots of holes for microbe contact
- Mounting tabs for easy installation
- Channels for wire connections
- Hollow areas to fill with carbon material

## What You Need

- [ ] Access to 3D printer or print service
- [ ] Electrode design files (STL format)
- [ ] PLA plastic filament (if printing yourself)
