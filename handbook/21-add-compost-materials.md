# Step 21: Add Initial Composting Materials

**What you're doing**: Start the composting process that will feed your energy-generating microbes.

## Layering Strategy

**Bottom layer (anaerobic zone)**:

- Coarse materials for drainage
- Includes some soil for microbes
- Around and between bottom electrodes

**Middle layer (transition zone)**:

- Mix of green and brown materials
- Around middle electrodes
- Balanced carbon/nitrogen ratio

**Top layer (aerobic zone)**:

- Finer materials that decompose quickly
- Good air exposure
- Around top electrodes

## Material Types

**"Green" materials (nitrogen-rich)**:

- Kitchen scraps (no meat/dairy)
- Fresh grass clippings
- Coffee grounds and filters

**"Brown" materials (carbon-rich)**:

- Dry leaves
- Shredded paper/cardboard
- Sawdust or wood chips

**Soil and activators**:

- Garden soil (adds beneficial microbes)
- Finished compost (jumpstarts process)
- Commercial compost activator (optional)

## Loading Process

**Bottom zone first**:

- Add coarse browns (sticks, larger pieces)
- Mix in soil and some finished compost
- Work materials around electrodes carefully

**Middle zone**:

- Alternate greens and browns in thin layers
- Keep materials balanced
- Don't pack too tightly

**Top zone**:

- Lighter materials that need more air
- Leave space for future additions
- Ensure good air circulation

## Initial Moisture

**Proper moisture level**:

- Materials should feel like wrung-out sponge
- Not dripping wet, not bone dry
- Add water gradually if needed

**Moisture for streaming potential**:

- Ceramic tubes need moisture to work
- Water helps ion movement
- Don't oversaturate

## What You Need

- [ ] Mix of green and brown compost materials
- [ ] Garden soil or finished compost
- [ ] Water source for moisture adjustment
- [ ] Compost thermometer (optional)
