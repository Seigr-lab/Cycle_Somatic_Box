# Step 22: Start Microbial Cultures

**What you're doing**: Introduce and encourage the beneficial microbes that will generate electricity from your compost.

## Understanding MFC Microbes

**Electroactive bacteria**:

- Special microbes that produce electricity
- Found naturally in soil and compost
- Multiply when conditions are right

**Where they come from**:

- Garden soil (natural source)
- Pond mud (rich in electroactive bacteria)
- Existing compost piles
- Commercial bacterial supplements

## Adding Microbial Inoculants

**Natural sources**:

- Mix handful of pond mud into bottom zone
- Add soil from healthy garden areas
- Include some material from active compost pile

**Commercial options**:

- EM (Effective Microorganisms) solution
- Compost activator products
- Specialized MFC bacterial cultures (if available)

## Creating Ideal Conditions

**Anaerobic bottom zone**:

- Keep moist but not waterlogged
- Limit air exposure to bottom materials
- Maintain steady temperature

**pH balance**:

- Slightly acidic to neutral (6.0-7.5 pH)
- Add lime if too acidic
- Add organic matter if too alkaline

**Temperature**:

- Room temperature to slightly warm (60-80°F)
- Insulation helps maintain steady temperature
- Avoid extreme cold or hot conditions

## Monitoring Development

**Voltage increase**:

- Start checking voltage after 3-5 days
- Should gradually increase over 2-4 weeks
- Initial: 0.1-0.3V, Target: 0.5-0.8V per electrode pair

**Visual signs**:

- Slight color changes around electrodes
- Biofilm formation on electrode surfaces
- Gradual settling of materials

## Troubleshooting Low Activity

**If voltage stays very low**:

- Check electrode connections
- Add more organic matter
- Adjust moisture levels
- Add more microbial inoculant

## What You Need

- [ ] Pond mud or rich garden soil
- [ ] pH test strips
- [ ] Lime and organic matter for pH adjustment
- [ ] Thermometer for temperature monitoring
- [ ] Multimeter for voltage tracking
