# Step 14: Add Thermal Management

**What you're doing**: Optimize heat flow to maximize electricity generation from your Peltier modules.

## Heat Flow Basics

**Maximum power needs maximum temperature difference**:

- Hot side as hot as possible
- Cold side as cool as possible
- Good heat conduction between them

## Hot Side Optimization

**Heat collection**:

- Direct contact with container wall
- Use thermal paste to eliminate air gaps
- Consider adding heat spreader plate

**Heat concentration**:

- Insulation forces heat through Peltier modules
- Remove insulation only where modules are mounted
- Creates focused hot spots

## Cold Side Optimization

**Heat rejection**:

- Add small heat sinks to cold side
- Keep heat sinks clean
- Position for good air circulation

**Seasonal adjustments**:

- Winter: full exposure to cold air
- Summer: may need shading to prevent overheating

## Thermal Paste Application

**Clean surfaces first**:

- Remove any dirt or oxidation
- Use alcohol to clean both surfaces

**Apply thermal paste**:

- Thin, even layer
- Cover entire contact area
- Too much paste reduces heat transfer

## Testing Heat Transfer

**Temperature monitoring**:

- Use infrared thermometer if available
- Hot side should be noticeably warm
- Cold side should stay cooler

**Voltage testing**:

- Peltier modules produce voltage immediately
- Higher temp difference = higher voltage
- Typical range: 1-5V per module

## What You Need
