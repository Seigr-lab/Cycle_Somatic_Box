# Step 04: Cut Ventilation Holes

**What you're doing**: Add air holes for proper composting and prevent anaerobic odors.

## Why Ventilation Matters

**Proper composting needs oxygen**:

- Prevents bad smells
- Keeps beneficial microbes healthy
- Controls moisture levels
- Makes better compost

## Hole Pattern

**Bottom holes** (drainage):

- 6-8 holes in the bottom
- 1/2 inch (12mm) diameter
- Evenly spaced

**Side holes** (air circulation):

- 12-15 holes around the sides
- 1/4 inch (6mm) diameter
- Two rows - upper and lower

**Top holes** (moisture control):

- 4-6 small holes in lid
- 1/8 inch (3mm) diameter

## Tools You Need

- [ ] Drill with bits (1/8", 1/4", 1/2")
- [ ] Marker to mark hole locations
- [ ] Ruler or measuring tape
- [ ] Safety glasses

## Drilling Tips

**Mark first, then drill**:

- Use marker to mark all hole locations
- Measure to keep holes evenly spaced
- Start with small pilot holes, then enlarge

**Prevent cracking**:

- Go slow with the drill
- Support the container while drilling
- Deburr holes with sandpaper
