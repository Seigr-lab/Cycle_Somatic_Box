# Step 01: Choose Your Location

**What you're doing**: Pick the best spot for your energy-generating composting box.

## Location Requirements

Your composting box needs:

- **Ground access** - for soil contact and drainage
- **Some shade** - prevents overheating, keeps moisture
- **Easy access** - you'll add compost materials regularly
- **Away from windows** - composting can have odors initially

## Best Locations

**Good choices**:

- Side yard with partial shade
- Back corner of garden
- Next to existing compost area
- Near garden beds (great for finished compost)

**Avoid**:

- Full sun all day (too hot)
- Low spots that flood
- Right next to house (potential odors)
- Areas with tree roots

## Check Your Spot

Walk to your chosen location and verify:

- [ ] You can dig a small hole (no concrete/roots)
- [ ] Water drains (doesn't pool after rain)
- [ ] You can access it easily with kitchen scraps
- [ ] Neighbors won't complain about composting
