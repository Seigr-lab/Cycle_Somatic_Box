# Step 13: Install Peltier Modules

**What you're doing**: Add thermoelectric modules that generate electricity from temperature differences in your composting system.

## What Are Peltier Modules

**Thermoelectric generators**:

- Convert temperature differences directly to electricity
- Work when one side is hotter than the other
- Perfect for composting heat vs outside temperature

**Best seasons**:

- Winter: compost warm, outside cold = maximum power
- Complements solar energy perfectly

## Finding Peltier Modules Sustainably

**Recycled sources**:

- Old portable coolers (remove TEG modules)
- Discarded electronic equipment (some contain TEGs)
- Broken solar generators or camping equipment
- Electronic recycling centers
- University/research lab surplus

**Specifications needed**:

- TEG (ThermoElectric Generator) type, not TEC (cooler)
- Any voltage output (can be adjusted later)
- Working condition (test before installing)

**How many needed**:

- Start with whatever you can find (even 1-2 modules work)
- Add more over time as you find them
- Focus on function over perfect specifications

## Installation Location

**On container sides**:

- Mount on insulated container walls
- Hot side touches container
- Cold side exposed to outside air

**Mounting method**:

- Thermal paste between module and container
- Clamp or bracket to maintain contact
- Weather protection for connections

## Thermal Management

**Hot side**:

- Direct contact with container wall
- Composting heat conducts through container
- Insulation helps concentrate heat

**Cold side**:

- Exposed to outside air
- Small heat sink improves performance
- Keep clean for best heat transfer

## What You Need

- [ ] Recycled Peltier TEG modules (from sources above)
- [ ] Thermal compound (toothpaste works temporarily!)
- [ ] Scrap metal or wood for mounting brackets
- [ ] Old computer heat sinks or metal pieces
- [ ] Salvaged wire and waterproof materials
