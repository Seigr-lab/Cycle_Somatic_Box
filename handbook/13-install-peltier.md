# Step 13: Install Peltier Modules

**What you're doing**: Add thermoelectric modules that generate electricity from temperature differences in your composting system.

## What Are Peltier Modules

**Thermoelectric generators**:

- Convert temperature differences directly to electricity
- Work when one side is hotter than the other
- Perfect for composting heat vs outside temperature

**Best seasons**:

- Winter: compost warm, outside cold = maximum power
- Complements solar energy perfectly

## Choosing Peltier Modules

**Specifications to look for**:

- TEG (ThermoElectric Generator) type, not TEC (cooler)
- 12V nominal output
- 50-100 watt capacity
- Bismuth telluride construction

**How many needed**:

- 4-6 modules for good power output
- More modules = more power
- Cost vs. benefit consideration

## Installation Location

**On container sides**:

- Mount on insulated container walls
- Hot side touches container
- Cold side exposed to outside air

**Mounting method**:

- Thermal paste between module and container
- Clamp or bracket to maintain contact
- Weather protection for connections

## Thermal Management

**Hot side**:

- Direct contact with container wall
- Composting heat conducts through container
- Insulation helps concentrate heat

**Cold side**:

- Exposed to outside air
- Small heat sink improves performance
- Keep clean for best heat transfer

## What You Need

- [ ] 4-6 Peltier TEG modules (12V)
- [ ] Thermal paste or pads
- [ ] Mounting brackets or clamps
- [ ] Small heat sinks (optional but helpful)
- [ ] Weather-resistant wire connections
